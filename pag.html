      <h2 id="g1">Guideline 1. Choose technologies (e.g. HTML vs. Flash) with accessibility in mind (Choosing Technologies)</h2>
      <div class="guideline_content">
        <p class="summary">When choosing a document type or a user interface technology (e.g. HTML, Flash, Flex, PDF, mobile application), choose the most accessible technology that can accomplish project requirements.</p>
 
        <h3>Rationale</h3>
        <p>Some media types have a much higher potential for accessibility than others.</p>
        <p>Even when two media types can each produce accessible results, choosing the most accessible technology will facilitate the process of making your product accessible.</p>

        <h3>HTML's Potential</h3>
        <p>HTML and XHTML have the highest potential for accessibility of any document type available today.</p>
        <p>HTML and XHTML provide access on multiple platforms and multiple browsers and work well with a wide variety of assistive technologies. (In this context, assistive technology is software and hardware that is used by people with disabilities to facilitate access to media.)</p>
        <p>HTML accessibility has been studied and refined for over 14 years and users of assistive technologies are typically comfortable working with HTML and XHTML.</p>
        <p>When coded with accessibility in mind, this media type gives users with disabilities:</p>
        <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
          <li>A choice of device, operating system and browser</li>
          <li>Access to all information presented</li>
          <li>The ability to use all controls</li>
          <li>The ability to skim the page for information without reading through the entire page</li>
          <li>Access to detailed text alternatives for complex images and also the ability to choose when and if to read those detailed text alternatives</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Added Benefits: HTML and XHTML are highly accessible because they are highly transformable and in widespread use. These qualities also make your content easy to reuse, to update and to transform for use with new technologies.
 
        <h3>JavaScripts's Potential</h3>
        <p>Including JavaScript in your HTML and XHTML media does not decrease the potential for accessibility. However, significant use of JavaScript introduces additional concerns that need to be addressed, primarily:</p>
        <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
          <li>Notifying users who do not see the screen or who do not see the entire screen of changes to the screen</li>
          <li>Making sure scripts work well when people use only a keyboard (no mouse) to navigate</li>
          <li>Designing custom user interfaces components so that they work for users who experience the page after it has been transformed for their needs (e.g. transformed into an auditory form for people with visual impairment)</li>
          <li>Rejecting inaccessible JavaScript libraries</li>
          <li>Ensuring that changes to the screen are properly recognized by assistive technology.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>While JavaScript's association with (X)HTML gives it a high potential for accessibility, as with any programming language, user interface functionality written in JavaScript requires testing. This should include testing with:</p>
        <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
          <li>Screen Readers (See <a href="#g4">PG 4</a>)</li>
          <li>Keyboard-only Access (See <a href="#g6">PG 6</a>)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This testing is easy to perform and provides experience with the types of user interfaces that we can expect for all users in emerging and future technologies.</p>
        <p>Note: Unless otherwise indicated, when JavaScript is mentioned in this document, it means JavaScript that runs within HTML or XHTML pages on the client-side.</p>

        <h3>PDF's Potential</h3>
        <p>Some PDF files are simply images of a document, without any real text, like a photo of a page in a book. While these files often allow users to zoom in on the document for easier reading, the documents are largely inaccessible to people with visual impairment.</p>
        <p>However, since PDF Version 1.4, it has been possible create documents that are compatible with assistive technologies, like screen readers, by placing a structure of tags, very similar to HTML tags, behind a PDF document:<br>
          <img src="images/pdf_tags.png" width="359" height="293" alt="The tags panel presents a hierarchy of tags that describe the structure of a PDF document, including Sect, Title, Heading 1, P, and Figure."></p>

        <p>As in HTML, it is possible even to make very detailed accommodations for accessibility, such as semantic mark up for complex data tables, including special attributes for telling screen readers exactly which data cells should be associated which header cells. When you use these tags and follow accessibility guidelines, PDF can be highly accessible with screen readers and can be keyboard accessible.</p>
        <p>Abobe Reader offers an array of features for text resize, magnification, and adjusting text colors. These work well for simple clean documents, but not very well for complex documents with multiple columns and boxes of text. While in HTML, users can apply custom style sheets to separately customize the appearance of different types of items (headings, lists etc) this is not possible in PDF with Adobe Reader as of <mark>Version 10.1</mark>.</p>
        <p>There are automated tools that help transform inaccessible PDF documents (even those that are just images of documents) into tagged PDF files. To fully take advantage of PDF's accessibility features, human review is required and most often PDF documents need post processing in Adobe Acrobat (version 6 or later). For complex documents with, for example, data tables, lists and links, this post-processing can be time-consuming.</p>
        <p>If the document originates in another program, such as Microsoft Word, following best practices in that program (like using heading styles and lists properly) can:</p>
        <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
          <li>Result in passably accessible documents in some simple cases
          <li>Reduce the amount of post-processing need in Acrobat
        </ul>

        <h4>Screen Reader Compatibility</h4>
        <p>Screen reader compatibility is available on Mac (VoiceOver) and Windows (JAWS, NVDA, <mark>WindowEyes</mark>). <mark>Access to the tagging structure is not available when reading PDF on iOS. On Android, you need to download special players to even access the speech using TalkBack. But, iOS and Android accessibility is improving rapidly, so it this may improve soon.</mark></p>

        <h4>Documentation for PDF accessibility</h4>
        <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
          <li>The Pearson Guidelines include PDF techniques.
          <li><a href="http://www.adobe.com/accessibility/products/acrobat/training.html">Adobe offers Guidance Specific to recent versions of Acrobat (8-11)</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/pdf.html">The W3C has published techniques for meeting WCAG 2.0 while creating PDF</a></li>
        </ul>
 
        <h3><mark>Flash and Flex's Potential</mark></h3>
        <p>Flash and Flex can be accessible, but it will not happen by accident, by checking "make movie accessible" in the Flash Authoring tool, or by including alternative text in an HTML embed tag. Like HTML, Flash / Flex accessibility requires specific detailed consideration during development.</p>
        <p>Flash and Flex accessibility techniques are considerably less widely known among developers compared with HTML accessibility techniques. As such, accessible Flash is not likely to come from a vendor who does not have specific experience developing accessible Rich Internet Applications.</p>
        <p>If you do want to work with a vendor who does not have accessibility experience, provide the following:</p>
        <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
          <li>Detailed Requirements for Flash Accessibility</li>
          <li>Accessibility Acceptance Testing (Make it clear upfront that you will not accept builds that don't include accessibility features for the functionality that is present. All too often developers attempt to tack-on accessibility at the end of the project, which typically results in a poor level of accessibility or causes accessibility to be perpetually pushed to a later release. Flash accessibility is not a separate feature to be developed independently of other functionality. While it can often be added after the fact, that actually involves revisiting and adapting objects and functionality and takes longer than including accessibility upfront. Flash developers who know how to accomplish Flash Accessibility include accessibility during development. Leaving it for later increases cost, increases schedule time and is a good sign that the vendor does not quite know how to accomplish accessibility in Flash.)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The easier option is to use a vendor who has experience with Accessible Rich Internet Applications. The effort it takes to find and choose a vendor who has accessibility experience, is likely to pay off in other ways, as writing accessible Flash and Flex requires a professional understanding of Flash or Flex and often involves understanding, using, and even rewriting libraries.</p>
        <p>It has been possible to create accessible Flash applications since Flash MX and the Flash Player 6; however, as implementing accessibility features targeted for the Flash Player 8+ has drastically reduced development time, these guidelines will provide techniques targeting Flash Player 8+.</p>
        <p>Some effort has been made to support accessible Flash in Firefox and some online sources indicate that Flash is accessible in Firefox. However, as of March 2009, the support is not stable. So, currently, Flash accessibility for screen reader users requires Internet Explorer on Windows. Since this is the platform support by the screen readers that are used by the vast majority of screen reader users, JAWS and Window-Eyes, this is not as problematic as it may seem at first.</p>
        <p>As with any programming language, user interface functionality written in ActionScript requires testing. This should include testing with:</p>
        <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
          <li>Screen Readers (See PG 4)</li>
          <li>Keyboard-only Access (See PG 6)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This testing is easy to perform and provides experience with the types of user interfaces that we can expect for all users in emerging and future technologies.</p>

        <h3>Android Applications's Potential</h3>
        <p>Android applications developed using Android 4.1 and later can be made accessible with the Android development framework. For more information on developing accessible Android applications see <a href="https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/accessibility/index.html">Android Accessibility API Guide</a>.</p>
        <p>With each new release of Android, new features to help users with disabilities are added. These features and settings can be found under the settings in the Accessibility option. Since the operating system can be changed by the device manufacture, some features may or may not be available on all devices. In Android Lollipop, the following features are available:</p>
        <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
          <li>Talkback and Explore by Touch</li>
          <li>Switch Access</li>
          <li>Just Speak</li>
          <li>Captions</li>
          <li>Magnification Gestures</li>
          <li>Large Text</li>
          <li>High Contract Text</li>
          <li>Accessibility Shortcut</li>
          <li>Touch &amp; Hold Delay</li>
          <li>Color Inversion</li>
          <li>Color Correction</li>
        </ul>
        <p>While Android application programming interface supports accessibility, as with any programming language, user interface written for Android requires testing. This should include testing with:</p>
        <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
          <li>Talkback and Explore by Touch</li>
          <li>Screen magnification and text resize settings</li>
          <li>Bluetooth keyboard, touch, and gestures</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>iOS Applications's Potential</h3>
        <p>All iOS applications developed using iOS 3.0 and later can be made accessible with the UI Accessibility programming interface. For more information on developing accessible iOS applications see Accessibility Programming Guide for iOS.</p>
        <p>With each new release of iOS, new features to help users with disabilities are added. These features and settings can be found under the General settings under Accessibility option. In iOS8, the following features are available:</p>
        <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
          <li>VoiceOver screen reader</li>
          <li>Zoom</li>
          <li>Invert Colors</li>
          <li>Greyscale</li>
          <li>Speech</li>
          <li>Larger Text</li>
          <li>Bold Text</li>
          <li>Button Shapes</li>
          <li>Increase Contrast</li>
          <li>Reduce Motion</li>
          <li>On/Off Labels</li>
          <li>LED flash for alerts</li>

          <li>Reachability</li>
          <li>Accessibility Shortcut</li>
        </ul>
        <p>While iOS application programming interface supports accessibility, as with any programming language, user interface written for iOS requires testing. This should include testing with:</p>
        <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
          <li>VoiceOver Screen Reader</li>
          <li>Screen magnification and text size settings</li>

      <h2 id="g2">Guideline 2. Allow users to adjust time limits (Time Limits)</h2>
      <div class="guideline_content">
        <p class="summary">Allow users to adjust short-term (20 hours or less) time limits to at least ten times the default.</p>
        <p>Note: If this would invalidate a timed activity, see <a href="#g3">Pearson Guideline 3</a>.</p>

        <h3>Rationale</h3>
        <p>Some users will need more time to complete activities than the average user. They may have a learning disability that causes reading or processing of information to take longer. Or, they may have a physical disability that slows access to the product.</p>
        <p>A time limit that causes a user to lose work or to return to the login page may create a frustrating cycle that prevents the user from completing the activity.</p>
        <p>"Twenty hours or less" and "ten times the default" were chosen based on the WCAG 2.0 guidelines, which were developed based on clinical research.</p>

        <h3>Techniques</h3>
        <p>Options Quoted from WCAG 2.0 (SC 2.2.1)</p>
        <blockquote><ul>
          <li>Turn off: The user is allowed to turn off the time limit before encountering it; or</li>
          <li>Adjust: The user is allowed to adjust the time limit before encountering it over a wide range that is at least ten times the length of the default setting; or</li>
          <li>Extend: The user is warned before time expires and given at least 20 seconds to extend the time limit with a simple action (for example, 'press the space bar'), and the user is allowed to extend the time limit at least ten times;</li>
        </ul></blockquote>
 
        <h3>K-3 Techniques</h3>
        <p>Students in the earliest grades may not be able to judge how much time they will need. A solution to this is to measure the student's ability to respond to a prompt or to activate a button through an introductory activity. Then, automatically adjust the timing for the main activity based on that data. This requires user-testing. Controls to further adjust timing should still be made available.</p>

Real-time Exception: the time limit is a required part of a real-time event (for example, an auction), and no alternative to the time limit is possible; or
Essential Exception: the time limit is part of an activity where timing is essential and time limits cannot be extended further without invalidating the activity.
20 Hour Exception: the time limit is longer than 20 hours.</mark></p>

      <div class="guideline_content">
        <p class="summary">If Pearson Guideline 2 would invalidate a timed activity:</p>
        <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
          <li><strong>Allow instructors or administrators to adjust time limits for particular students</strong></li>
          <li>OR <strong>Allow students to adjust the time or just complete the activity after the time limit is reached. And, record the time spent with the results.</strong></li>
        </ul>
 
        <h3>Rationale</h3>
        <p>Some students with disabilities need additional time to complete activities. The school's specialists determine the amount of additional time students should receive on timed activities. This provides just enough additional time to account for performing the mechanics of the activity (e.g. reading, writing, operating a computer) with a disability. So, schools often assign accommodations such as "time and a half" or "double time".</p>
        <p>By following this guideline, we meet the schools' need for products that allow extended time.</p>

      <h2 id="g4">Guideline 4. Check the order that content is read in screen readers &amp; correct any issues (Sensible Reading Order)</h2>
      <div class="guideline_content">
        <p class="summary">Ensure that current screen reading software (screen readers) can read the media in a sensible order.</p>
        <p>Note: In many cases, the reading order will be fine naturally. The techniques offered here explain how the reading order is established and how to make corrections if needed.</p>

        <h3>Rationale</h3>
        <p>Screen readers, browsers, and media players work together to try to provide a sensible reading order. However, sometimes the organization of the content results in a reading order that does not make sense. For example, commonly, features that are listed side-by-side might be read intermixed with each other, as in the table below:</p>
        <table class="pe-table--borders">
          <caption class="pe-sr-only">an unstructured table (antipattern) showing 2 rows, 4 cells of content and listing their reading order</caption>

              <p>(read second)</p>

            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>
              <p>(read third)</p>
              <ul class="pe-list--unstyled">

              </ul>
            </td>
            <td>
              <p>(read fourth)</p>
              <ul class="pe-list--unstyled">
                <li>8 AM Breakfast – Cafeteria</li>
                <li>12:30 Lunch – Ball Room 1</li>
                <li>6:30 Dinner – Ball Room 2</li>

            </td>

        </table>
        <p>This type of issue can be resolved without changing the visual layout. For example, in HTML, we restructure the underlying source code. In Flash, we indicate a reading order by numbering elements behind the scenes.</p>

        <h3>HTML &amp; JavaScript</h3>
        <h4>Layout Tables (legacy)</h4>
        <p>The reading order for a layout table begins with the first cell in the first row. In left-to-right languages, like English, this is the left-most cell in the top row. The cell adjacent to that cell is next, and so on. Then the second row is read in the same way. The image below shows the reading order for a layout table in a left-to-right language:<br>
        <img width="276" height="181" alt="A table is read from left to right. First row: first and second cells. Second row: third, fourth and fifth cells. Third row: sixth cell." src="images/Table_order.png"></p>
        <p>This is actually the source code order. If your content does not make logical sense following that order:</p>
        <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
          <li><p>Update to a CSS layout where the source code order is logical</p>
 OR</li>
          <li>Reorganize the table layout so that the contents appear in a logical order in the source code. And, add <code>role="presentation"</code> to the opening <code>&lt;table&gt;</code> tag for layout tables to prevent screen readers from announcing the table structure.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>CSS Layouts</h4>
        <p>The reading order follows the source code order in html and xhtml, regardless of how the items are arranged on the page using CSS. So, be sure to place elements and content in a logical reading order in the source code. This will also make your page readable when CSS positioning is over-ridden, turned off, or not available.</p>
        <p>A common challenge occurs when Web developers wish to have a horizontal list of letters or numbers situated at the right side of the screen. Often they place these links in the source code backwards (for example, z through a), and then they use CSS <code>float:right</code> to float each item to the right. Since z is first, it floats all they way to the right and the rest of the letters follow, line up and look correct visually. <mark><a href="http://wps.pearsoned.com/wps/media/objects/7400/7577911/PG4CSS2.html">Open example of incorrect use of float: right in a new window</a>.</mark> However, the links are backwards for screen reader users and users who have turned off CSS. To resolve this, put the links in a-z order in a <code>div</code> element. Then, size the <code>div</code> so that it is only just large enough for the links. Finally, apply CSS <code>float:right</code> to the <code>div</code>. <mark><a href="http://wps.pearsoned.com/wps/media/objects/7400/7577911/PG4CSS2FIX.html">Open example of corrected use of float:right in a new window</a>.</mark></p>

        <h4>When JavaScript and/or CSS is used to Place Elements on the Page</h4>
        <p>As mentioned above, the reading order in HTML follows the source code order. So, if you use JavaScript to write source code, as you might do using <code>document.write</code> or by setting innerHTML, just add it in a location where it makes sense. Similarly, if elements are typed into the html source and then hidden or shown using JavaScript, as you might do using display:none and display:block, just place them in the source code according to the order in which the page should be read.</p>
        <p>However, if you use Document Object Model coding to add elements to the page, the reading order might not follow the source code order. When objects are created and stored in variables, the order in which the code is written is not relevant. Instead, the structure of the Document Object Model itself will determine the reading order. Within each object in the Document Object Model, starting with the document object, child nodes are read in order from the first node to the last node (<code>x.childNodes[0], x.childNodes[1] ... x.lastChild</code>). As each child object is encountered, its children are read in a similar fashion, so that the tree is read as shown in the following example, where a <code>div</code> object contains the following child objects:</p>
        <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--ordered">
          <li> some text ("a text node" in DOM terminology)</li>
          <li> a link</li>
          <li> an ordered list with three child list items</li>
          <li> an image with an alt attribute</li>
        </ul>
        <p><img width="400" height="230" alt="The items are read in the following order: the text node, the link, the ordered list items (first through third) and finally the image." src="images/DOM_order.png"><br>
        So, when dynamically adding nodes to the document object model (e.g. appendChild, insertBefore, replaceChild) place them in a logical location in the document tree. For example, if a newly added paragraph should be read just before an ordered list with id L, you might add it as follows:</p>
        <pre><code>
/* Create paragraph */ 
var newP = document.createElement("p");
/* Backslash below escapes line break */
var PText = document.createTextNode("This \
            list will help with the questions \
            you missed!");
newP.appendChild(PText);
/* Get existing ordered list  */
var existingL = document.getElementById("L");
/* Get parent of existing ordered list  */
var parentObj = existingL.parentNode 
/*Place new paragraph inside the parent of the ordered list, just before the ordered list  */
parentObj.insertBefore(newP, existingL);</code></pre>
        <p>And, in this example, a new paragraph is created and is placed just after an ordered list with id <code>L</code>:</p>
        <pre><code>
/* Create paragraph */
var newP = document.createElement("p");
var PText = document.createTextNode("Good job with the list; now take a break!");
newP.appendChild(PText);
/* Get existing ordered list  */
var existingL = document.getElementById("L");
/* Get parent of existing ordered list  */
var parentObj = existingL.parentNode
/* Get the next sibling of the existing ordered list */
var nextS = existingL.nextSibling
/* don't worry if there's a chance nextS will be null - see below */
/* Place new paragraph inside the parent of the ordered list,  just after the ordered list  */
parentObj.insertBefore(newP, nextS);
/* if nextS is null, insertBefore will place newP at the end of parentObj, which would be just after the existing ordered list, in that case. */</code></pre>
 
        <h3><mark>Flash &amp; Flex</mark></h3>
        <p><mark>Reading order in Flash and Flex is set according to an algorithm that chooses the next item to read based on which item is top-most and/or left-most. As such, if you have a purely vertical layout, the movie will be read from top to bottom. This is often a sensible reading order. Similarly, if you have a purely horizontal layout, the movie will be read from left to right, which again, is often a sensible reading order. However, when there are both vertical and horizontal elements, the reading order often becomes nonsensical and confusing.

If you test your movie or application in JAWS and the reading order makes sense, there is nothing else that you need to do to meet PG 4. 

If you test your movie or application in JAWS and the reading order does not make sense, you will need to set the tabIndex for each item in your movie that should be read with a screen reader. TabIndex in Flash/Flex works differently from the tabindex property in HTML. In Flash/Flex, when correcting the reading order, you must set the tabIndex for every element that a screen reader should read, including buttons, links, form fields, other active element, and any text elements.

You can set tabIndex in the accessibility panel in the Flash authoring tool.
You can also set tabIndex using action script: myObject.tabIndex = 10;
You can set tabIndex in MXML (Mark-up used in Flex Builder, Flex Server, or Flash Builder Applications): <code>&lt;mx:Text x="35" y="27" tabIndex="10" text="Welcome Students!" /&gt;</code>
You can skip numbers when setting tabIndex. So, counting by 10 is wise, as it allows you to insert items in the middle of the reading order without renumbering every item. For example, if you realize you need a new item between the items with tabIndex 20 and 30, you can use a tabIndex of 25.</mark></p>
        <h4><mark>Additional Details</mark></h4>
        <p><mark>In order to set the reading order using tabIndex, you will need to avoid using static text. In addition, there are special considerations regarding instance names, off-screen elements, and embedded movies. See <a href="http://www.adobe.com/accessibility/products/flash/reading.html">Adobe's Flash Reading Order Guide (new window)</a> for additional details.</mark></p>

        <h4><mark>Common Misconception</mark></h4>
        <p><mark>Many developers worry that setting tabIndex this way will force keyboard access users to tab to each bit text while trying to reach a button, link or form control. This is true in HTML, but this is not the case in Flash and Flex. TabIndex does not change whether or not an element is treated as an active element for keyboard access.</mark></p>

        <h3>Android Applications</h3>
        <p>The reading over is based on an algorithm which finds the nearest neighbor in a given direction. The reading order cannot be changed but focus order can be modified, see <a href="#g6">PG 6</a> for more details.</p>

        <h3>iOS Applications</h3>
        <p>The reading order in iOS applications is defined by the order in which the elements are added to the screen. In the individual, table or custom container views, the order is set by the order in which they are defined in the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/accessibility/uiaccessibilitycontainer">UIAccessibilityContainer</a> protocol array.  To change the reading order use <code>accessibilityElementAtIndex</code>, <code>accessibilityElementCount</code> and <code>indexOfAccessibilityElement</code>.</p>

        <h3>PDF in Acrobat</h3>
        <img style="float:right" alt="" src="images/tags-tree.jpg">
        <p>The reading order in a PDF document is determined by the order of the tags in the tags tree.</p>
        <p>If the reading order of the PDF document is not sensible, simply drag the tags for the elements into the desired order in Acrobat's tags panel. This will not affect the visual layout.</p>
        <p>The location of the tags panel will vary depending on your version of Acrobat. In Acrobat 9 Pro, for example, you can find the panel at View &gt; Navigation Panels &gt; Tags.</p>
        
        <h3 style="clear:both;">Word</h3>
        <p>The reading order in a Word document is often fine and cannot be modified as it can in HTML or a PowerPoint presentation. In Word, content is read top-down, left-right. Tables are also read in this order which works well for typical data tables but can cause similar issues as HTML tables when used for layout.</p>
        <p>To avoid empty paragraphs, use paragraph spacing and column breaks for fine control of text placement. This will reduce how often screen readers such as JAWS says blank when navigating with reading keys.</p>

        <h3>Text Boxes and Floating Images</h3>
        <p>Avoid using text boxes and floating images. Screen readers often do not read the content of text boxes and do not announce their presence. When using images, use "inline" text wrapping to ensure that they are read with the text in the correct order. Images that float in front of the text have the same issues as text boxes.</p>

        <h3>PowerPoint</h3>
        <p>The reading order in PowerPoint is determined by the order shown in the selection pane, <strong>and that order is from the bottom to the top of the list of elements</strong>. Use the buttons in the selection pane to arrange the items properly. Consider making this adjustment for each master slide layout of the template to reduce future work.</p>
        <p>When adding any new elements to a slide, check the reading order to ensure that it presents the content in a way that makes sense. In PowerPoint 2007 and 2010, use the selection pane. The reading order is the order in which the shapes are listed starting with the bottom-most item to top.<br>
        <img width="450" height="282" alt="Go to Home menu and choose select in the editing menu.  In the drop down menu, choose Selection Pane.  Use the re-order buttons to move content in the list." src="images/PowerPoint-ReadingOrder.jpg"></p>
        <p>In PowerPoint 2003, the reading order is determined using the outline panel and the drawing order. The outline panel provides an outline of the text content that appears on the slides. For content that does not appear in the outline panel, tab through the elements of the slide to verify the order. To change the order, right click and element and choose Order. This command is also available on the Drawing toolbar. As with all versions of PowerPoint, save time by ensuring that the order of the master slide layouts is correct before adding slides.</p>

In that case, the reading order would alternate between the sign-in and the register sections. Also, lists of numbered or lettered links aligned to the right are often in a backwards reading order.

      <h2 id="g5">Guideline 5. Make sure screen reader users can find dynamic additions to the screen (Findable Added Content)</h2>
      <div class="guideline_content">
        <p class="summary">Ensure that screen reader users can find new dynamically-added content (e.g. expanding menus, alerts, error messages, hints that appear on rollover).</p>

        <h3>Rationale</h3>
        <p>When the content of page changes once the page has loaded, some accessibility concerns arise that are not addressed by accessibility guidelines for static content:</p>
        <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
          <li>How will a screen reader user who may already have read much of the page know that the new content is now available?</li>
          <li>How will a screen reader user know where to find the new content?</li>
          <li>Will common screen reader applications recognize changes to the page?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Since dynamic content changes and additions are most often designed and tested by users who can see a large portions of the screen at once, these features most often work well for such users. These features can also work well for screen reader users, but they must be designed and tested with this type of access in mind.</p>

        <h3>HTML &amp; JavaScript</h3>
        <h4>Error Messages that Appear without a Page Refresh | Custom Alert Windows that don't Contain Buttons or other User Interaction</h4>
        <p>The goal is to alert screen reader users to the new information. In addition, especially if the feedback appears while the user is typing into a field, the goal will be to provide the error message without moving the screen reader user's focus (i.e. without taking the text-insertion point out of the form field).</p>
        <p>The WAI-ARIA "alert" role makes this possible. Simply make <code>role="alert"</code> an attribute of <strong>both</strong>:
        <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
          <li><p>The outer-most container that is added to the page</p>
            <p>~AND~</p></li>
          <li>The parent element of that element. Create a container just for the purpose of receiving the alert. (Needed for Safari with VoiceOver as well as, the lower priority configuration, Window-Eyes with IE)</li>
        </ul>
        <p><mark>To support TalkBack with Chrome on Android devices add <code>aria-live="assertive"</code> to the container element that will receive the alert. Although not a top priority configuration, this is also needed to support NVDA with IE.</mark></p>
        <mark>** HI PRIO ** external link</mark>
        <p><mark><a href="http://www.manateeroad.com/alert.html">A test page for this technique</a></mark></p>
        <p>This will cause screen readers to speak the error or alert when it appears visually. But, it won't make any change to the screen reader user's location on the page. So, for example, if a user is typing a password when the message is read, the user can continue to type that password, uninterrupted.</p>
        <p>In screen magnifiers, sometimes the magnification level is so high that only a small section of the screen is shown at once. Magnifiers can be set to move focus to alerts and this will cause the error message or the upper left corner of the error message (in left-to-right languages) to be shown on the screen. Because of this, the upper left corner (or upper right in right-to-left languages) of the alert object should show the beginning of the error message.</p>
        <p>Note: <code>role="alert"</code> has no effect if it is just on the page when the page loads. The role only comes into play when the area is updated without a page refresh. As such, when an identical page, except for an added alert message, is loaded, different techniques are needed. See the section just below on this topic.</p>

        <h4>Error Messages that Appear with Page Refresh</h4>
        <p>In this scenario, screen reader users will hear that a new page has loaded. Because of this, the error message is not actually dynamically-added content! However, particularly if the page is the very same page shown again, it is good usability for screen readers users to make it easy to locate the error message. Some combination of the following techniques should be used:</p>
        <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
          <li>Most often, screen readers read the title of the page when the page loads. So, it is helpful to including all or part of the error message in the page title.</li>
          <li>The most common way that screen reader users explore a new page is that they read the headings on the page. Making all or part of the error message a heading is very helpful.</li>
          <li>Screen reader users often tab from form element to form element, hearing the form label for each form element. In cases where detailed form error messages are provided for each form field, including those errors as part of the form label can be a helpful technique. See <a href="g14">Pearson Guideline 14</a> for techniques on how to code form labels so that they will be read when screen reader users tab to form elements.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you allow the page to load without the error message, and then add the error message using JavaScript after the page has fully loaded, you can use the <code>role="alert"</code> technique described in the section just above.</p>

        <h4>Standard JavaScript Alert, Confirm, and Prompt Messages</h4>
        <p>Common screen readers and screen magnifiers should be able to handle these without any special coding.</p>
        <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
          <li>Confirm: <code>var r=confirm("Continue?");</code></li>
          <li>Alert: <code>alert('Please login first');</code> OR</li>
          <li>Prompt: <code>var name=prompt("Please enter your name","");</code></li>
        </ul>
        <p>For information on using these and for examples, see: <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_popup.asp">w3schools.com's JavaScript Popup Windows (opens in new window)</a>.</p>

        <h4>Custom Dialogs that need to be Dismissed by the User | Custom Modal Windows</h4>
        <p>When the dialog appears, use JavaScript to move focus to the interactive element in the dialog that is most likely to be used first. When the dialog is closed, be sure to return focus to a logical location, such as the control that caused the dialog to appear.</p>
        <p>If the dialog serves an "alert" function, add the following two attributes to the outermost element that is added to the page when the message appears:</p>
        <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
          <li><p><code>role="alertdialog"</code></p> 
            <p>~AND~</p></li>
          <li><code>aria-describedby="id"</code> where <code>id</code> is the id of the message you want read automatically when the alert dialog first appears.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If the dialog isn't really an "alert" and is more of just a separate window, add the following two attributes to the outermost element that is added to the page when the message appears:</p>
        <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
          <li><p><code>role="dialog"</code></p>
            <p>~AND~</p></li>
          <li><code>aria-label="my message"</code> where <code>my message</code> is the message you want read automatically when the dialog first appears OR <code>aria-labelledby="id"</code> where <code>id</code> is the id of the message you want read automatically when the alert dialog first appears. (Yes, aria-labelledby should have the repeated letter l.)</li> 
        </ul>
        <p>These attributes tell screen readers and screen magnifiers to announce these additions to the screen as alert dialogs or as dialogs. Some screen readers will also switch into "forms mode" for navigation of the dialog. In this mode, the dialog is announced and then screen reader users move between active elements, often skipping inactive content. So, be sure that all content in the dialog is included through <code>aria-describedby</code>, <code>aria-label</code>, or <code>aria-labelledby</code> and/or through form labels. Form labels are discussed in detail in <a href="#g14">Pearson Guideline 14</a>.</p>
        <p>For older configurations that don't support <code>role="alertdialog"</code> or <code>role="dialog"</code>, try to give an overview of the purpose of the dialog with the control that gains focus. For example, you might use "stay on this page" as your button text, instead of something less descriptive, such as "stay".</p>

        <h4>Buttons that Reveal Content (e.g. expanding menus, expanding help topics)</h4>
        <p>One of the simplest techniques is to place the new content in the reading order just after the control that initiated the change.</p>
        <p>It is important that users will know whether the section is expanded or collapsed. See <a href="#g20">Pearson Guideline 20</a> for information on this.</p>

        <h4>When Important Information Appears on Mouse Over</h4>
        <p>Often information is coded to appear <code>onmouseover</code> and <code>onfocus</code>. For example, when a mouse is pointed at a book cover image, a <code>div</code> element might appear as a box that provides more information about the book.</p>
        <p>This information is at risk of being inaccessible to screen reader users. It only appears in the reading order for a short time, often while the screen reader is reading other content. You will have to decide if the information should always be read by the screen reader. If the information is essential or particularly brief, it is likely it should always be read, so you might:</p>
        <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
          <li>Include the information as alt-text for a related image, OR</li>
          <li><p>Keep the information visible to screen readers even when it is hidden for visual users by placing the information off-screen:</p>
          <pre><code>.screen_readers_only {
  position:absolute;
  left:-999px;
  top:auto;
  width:1px;
  height:1px;
  overflow:hidden; }</code></pre></li>
        </ul>
        <p>If the information is rather long and not necessary for a basic understanding of the page, it might be best if it is not part of the general reading order. To allow the content to be read on-demand only:</p>
        <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
          <li><p>Include the information in the <code>longdesc</code> attribute of a related image:</p>
          <pre><code>&lt;img src="weather_today.gif"
  alt="Sunny 73 degrees"
  longdesc="weather_detail.html&gt;"</code></pre> OR</li>
          <li><p>Place the information on a second page and provide a link placed off screen so that the link is only available to screen reader users:</p>
          <pre><code>a.screen_readers_only {
  position:absolute;
  left:-999px;
  top:auto;
  width:1px;
  height:1px;
  overflow:hidden; }</code></pre></li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Areas that Update Periodically (e.g. News Feed, Social Features)</h4>
        <p>First, place the new content in a predictable consistent location within the page structure. The containing structure for this content should have a heading that tells the user what the section is for. Consider including the following information:</p>
        <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
          <li>That the area is dynamic</li>
          <li>Which conditions that will cause an update</li>
          <li>Which content is currently present (or newest)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For example:</p>
        <pre><code>&lt;h2&gt;Hourly News as of 1 PM Today&lt;/h2&gt;</code></pre>
        <p>In this case, a screen reader user will know that the section may be updated and can use heading reading techniques to scan the headings on the page and discover whether an update has been made.</p>
        <p>If all or part of the heading is not needed for sighted users, you can hide the heading as follows:</p>
          <pre><code>h2.hidden {
  position:absolute;
  left:-999px;
  top:auto;
  width:1px;
  height:1px;
  overflow:hidden; }</code></pre>
        <p>Second, particularly for social features, there should be a way for students or instructors to be notified that new information is available. The following techniques are some options. You may wish to allow your users to select an option in user preferences.</p>
        <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
          <li>Make any text that announces the new content into an alert by placing role="alert" on the outermost HTML element that is added to the page when the icon or the alert appears. For example: <code>&lt;div role="alert"&gt;You have a new message&lt;/div&gt;</code></li>
          <li>Play a beep or a tone when a new message appears. (Thanks to Michael Brooks of Penn State University for suggesting this technique and for pointing out that this has worked well for some students.)</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Progress Bars and Loading Messages</h4>
        <p>If you know the percent progress, <mark>** HI PRIO ** <a href="http://www.manateeroad.com/progressbar.html">use a progress bar as is shown here</a>.</mark> Of course, the visual can be whatever you like. While the WAI-ARIA specification implies that a variety of types of values may one day work, this only works in current screen readers/browser with percent values.</p>
        <p>If you don’t know the percent progress, and the load times are very short, one possibility is to use an alert that says "Page is loading" and then move focus to the new content when it is ready.</p>
        <p>If you don’t know the percent progress and if the load times are longer, chose what you think is a max load time for the activity, then create a time-base version of this where the progress bar reaches 100% at that max time. This way, most of the time, the progress will be better than what the bar reports, which is fine. Have the progress bar code loop (start over at 0%, once it reaches 100%), just in case there is a very long load time.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/complete#progressbar">Read more about progress bars in the WAI-ARIA spec</a></p>

        <h3>Android Applications</h3>
        <p><mark>The goal is to help Talkback (the Android screen reader) users know about the important information. When the application interface elements change dynamically, the <code>contentDescription</code> and <code>hint</code> property should be updated to reflect the current state of the interface element. If the dynamically-added content should be read by the screen reader, move focus to that component on the page so it will be read by Talkback.</mark> (still valid?)</p>

        <h3>iOS Applications</h3>
        <p><mark>When the application interface elements change dynamically, the <code>accessibilityLabel</code> and <code>accessibilityHint</code> should be updated to reflect the current state of the interface element.</mark> (still valid?)</p>
        <p>If the layout of the application screens change or if there is an event that happens on the screen, use the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/accessibility/uiaccessibility">UIAccessibilityNotifications in the UIAccessibility protocol</a> to send status notifications to VoiceOver to help users navigate the new layout.</p>

        <h3>PowerPoint</h3>
        <p>PowerPoint presentations can have dynamic content in the form of slide animations. Be sure to test animations with a screen reader because a content is not always read consistently. It is best to use animations triggered by mouse clicks so that it can be controlled by the user during a slideshow. Animations triggered by mouse clicks can be controlled using both a mouse and keyboard.</p>

        <p>By ensuring that our content supports keyboard access, we provide access to a number of user groups who do not use a mouse.</p>
        <p>Additional Benefit: Many mobile device users also rely on keyboard access.</p>

        <h3>General Techniques</h3>
        <h4>The Basics</h4>
        <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
          <li>Make sure that keyboard-only users can get to each active element (e.g. link, form field, control). This is usually accomplished using tab keys and arrow keys.</li>
          <li>Just getting to links and controls is not enough, make sure keyboard-only users can also activate each active element (e.g. link, form field, control). This is usually accomplished using enter key or space bar.</li>
          <li>Finally, make sure that keyboard-only users can escape each element to return to other items on the page.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Be Mindful that Learning New Key Presses can be Burdensome</h4>
        <p>Wherever possible, use the keyboard access methods and keys that are the default in the particular technology you are using, rather than inventing new access methods that users will need to learn.</p>

        <h4>Hidden Content</h4>
        <p>Make sure that hidden active elements (e.g. links, form fields, controls) are not part of the tab order. It can be be very frustrating and disorienting to have to press tab again and again to step through hidden content. Users may assume that there's no keyboard access at all.</p>

        <h4>Do Not Require Physically Skilled Key Pressing</h4>
        <p>Do not require users to hold down keys for a certain amount of time or to accomplish any other specific timing of key presses.</p>

        <h4>MouseOver Effects</h4>
        <p>Provide equivalents for keyboard access users when MouseOver effects:</p>
        <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
          <li>provide information or reveal new user interface elements</li>
          <li>provide a different (e.g. clearer, simplified, larger) view of information</li>
          <li>provide functionality</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Category Drag &amp; Drop</h4>
        <p>When users need to put items into categories, one approach is to have a menu of categories pop up when the user tabs to one of the items and hits enter.</p>
        <p>The Up and Down Arrow Keys allow the user to select between categories in the menu. Hitting Space Bar selects the category and so drops the item into that category. Tab and Shift Tab can move the user to the next item or previous item.</p>
        <p><mark>(the modern keystrokes are: spacebar to select an item; enter and/or ctrl+m to drop an item. Tab or arrows to move around between focusable draggables or destinations).</mark><br>
        <img width="230" height="155" src="images/fruNveg.jpg" alt="Example: Users drag words like 'olives' and 'tomatoes' into two categories: 'Fruits' and 'Vegetables."></p>

        <h4>Matching Drag &amp; Drop</h4>
        <p>When users need to match elements of one list with elements of another list, users will need a way to select an item, jump easily to the other list, and then select the matching item. Users should be able to begin from either list. Simple keystrokes can be used to allow this. Tab and Shift Tab can be used to jump back and forth between the lists. Up and Down Arrow Keys can be used to move within the list. Enter can be used to select items to drag (or begin matching line). And Space can be used to select locations to drop (or complete matching line). This way, if a user choses an item, but then decides not to match that item yet, they can select another item using Enter.<br>
        <img width="254" height="127" src="images/nvda.jpg" alt="Example: Users draw lines between words by dragging words from one list to words in another list."></p>

        <h4>Fill-in-the-Blanks Drag &amp; Drop</h4>
        <p>When an exercise allows a user to choose from a list of words and drag those words into blanks in a paragraph, a key part of working through the answers is being able to glance back at the list of words while reading the paragraph. To provide a parallel experience for screen reader users, one strategy is to provide a special view where the blanks are replaced with pull down menus. This will also be useful for people who do not use a mouse because of mobility or dexterity issues.<br>
        <img width="260" height="160" src="images/dragNdrop.jpg" alt="Example: Users drag words from a list into a paragraph with blanks."></p>

        <h4>Details</h4>
        <p>Add a link, such as "Use Activity without a Mouse" to the user interface. Make sure link is just after the drag-and-drop instructions in the reading order, so that screen reader users can find it quickly.<br>
        <img width="670" height="407" src="images/drag_fill_before.jpg" alt=""></p>

        <p>When the "Use Activity without a Mouse" link is clicked, replace the blanks with pull down menus and replace the link with a link such as "Use Drag and Drop".<br>
        <img width="681" height="407" src="images/drag_fill_after.jpg" alt=""></p>

        <h3>HTML</h3>
        <h4>In-Page Links</h4>
        <p>When coding in-page anchor links, code the target of the in-page link using an <code>a</code> element with <code>tabindex="-1"</code>. This ensures that you will avoid two bugs in Internet Explorer (versions 5-8) that break keyboard access. Without tabindex="-1" many inpage links will appear to work visually when first activated, but when the user tries to move forward using the tab key, the user is brought back to the skip link instead of moving forward on the page.</p>

        <h4>Image Maps</h4>
        <p>When creating image maps, use <code>usemap</code>, <code>&lt;map&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;area&gt;</code>. Do not use <code>ismap</code> or the x and y coordinates provided by <code>input type="image"</code> to create image maps. Browsers allow keyboard access users to tab to area elements, but do not support selecting a location using the keyboard in image maps created using <code>ismap</code> or <code>input type="image"</code>.</p>
        <p>Note: Image maps that use <code>area</code> elements are often called client-side image maps, while the others are often called server-side image maps. Despite the terminology, only maps created using <code>area</code> elements offer keyboard access, regardless of whether you add server-side or client-side scripting to <code>ismap</code> or <code>input type="image"</code>.</p>

        <h4>Considerations if you are changing the tab order</h4>
        <p>Allow the tab order to follow the reading order. (This occurs automatically, unless you change the tab order.) Tab orders that have been set based on <code>tabindex</code> are difficult to maintain. They can cause a mismatch between the tab order and the reading order. This can be disorienting for screen reader users. Unless screen reader usability testing with skilled screen reader users is planned, do not reset the tab order using <code>tabindex</code>.</p> 

        <h4>Keyboard Shortcuts</h4>
        <p>Common browsers allow <code>accesskey</code> attributes to override keyboard access to browser menus. <code>Accesskey</code> attributes can also override the keystroke commands that allow keyboard access with a screen reader. Do not use <code>accesskey</code> unless:</p>

        <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
          <li>You use only numeric <code>accesskey</code> values (0-9)
            <p>OR</p>
          </li>
          <li>The access keys are not active by default. Instead, the user can switch them on after reviewing the list of keys in user preferences.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>New Browser Windows</h4>
        <p>If you are opening a new browser window, it is <strong>not</strong> necessary to provide keyboard shortcuts to close or minimize the window. Instead, you <strong>should</strong> rely on the operating system's keyboard commands for adjusting windows.</p>
        <p>Here are the commands used for Windows and Mac:</p>
        <table class="pe-table">
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th scope="col">Operating System</th>
              <th scope="col">Minimize</th>
              <th scope="col">Close</th>
              <th scope="col">Menu of Options</th>
            </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <th scope="row">Windows</th>
              <td>Alt Space, then n</td>
              <td>Alt F4</td>
              <td>Alt Space</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <th scope="row">Mac</th>
              <td>Command m</td>
              <td>Command w</td>
              <td></td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>
    
        <h3>JavaScript</h3>
        <p>Be Careful using <code>blur()</code> ("Stop the Ants")</p>
        <p>Do not trigger <code>blur()</code> for an element in response to an <code>onFocus</code> event for that element. This prevents keyboard access for the element. This mistake is often made when developers wish to remove the outline that appears around a link when the link is clicked. Instead, use the following CSS code to remove that outline in modern browsers (e.g. Firefox 3+, Internet Explorer 8+).</p>
        <pre><code>a:active {     outline-width: 0; }</code></pre>
        <p>The CSS above uses <code>a:active</code>. Do NOT use <code>a:focus</code> or even just <code>a</code> in the code above, as this would hide the focus indicator (See <a href="#g7">PG 7</a>).</p>

        <h4>Select Menus and OnChange</h4>
        <p>Avoid using select menus with <code>onchange</code> handlers where the handler changes focus or causes an irreversible event like sending a message or submitting a form. In such cases just rely on a "Go" button instead of an onchange handler.</p>
        <h5>Here are the problems with select menus and <code>onchange</code> handlers:</h5>
        <p>In Internet Explorer, if you use arrow keys to move up or down in a select menu with an <code>onchange</code> handler, the <code>onchange</code> event triggers with each move. If that handler changes focus you will be moved away from the select menu with one up or down arrow; if it results in some irreversible action, then, just by an innocuous move in a menu, you have caused that action. On the other hand, if you first use alt+down-arrow to open the select menu and then use arrow keys in the open list, no <code>onchange</code> event fires until you press enter or tab out of the menu. This situation is aggravated by the fact that the most popular screen reader says, "Combo box, to change the selection use the arrow keys." This particular problem is specific to Internet Explorer.</p>
        <p>For other browsers (Chrome, Firefox, and Safari) and for Internet Explorer when alt+down-arrow is used to open the menu, the <code>onchange</code> event does not trigger until you press enter or tab out of the control. So for all of the browsers, when you tab out of the open select menu, the corresponding on-change action, possibly irreversible, is taken and you might have thought that you were just leaving the control. Again, use the "Go" button in such cases.</p>

        <h4>Custom Controls</h4>
        <p>Make sure that custom controls are keyboard accessible using one of these techniques:</p>
        <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
          <li><p>(BEST) Start with HTML/XHTML elements that are interactive by default (e.g. a, <code>button</code>, <code>input</code>*). For example, you may wish to have a box that acts as a control that changes the page. Instead of making a <code>div</code> element interactive, you might use a <code>button</code> element. This way, you take advantage of well-tested standard keyboard access that comes with elements that are interactive by default. You can use CSS to adjust the <code>button</code> element to appear as you wish:</p> 
            <pre><code>button.myactivebox {
width: 3em;
height: 3em;
float: left;
/* remove browser-provided 3d edge effect */
border: 0;
/* remove color assigned by browser */
background: transparent;
/* add basic link-style cursor for mouse users*/
cursor: pointer;
}</code></pre>
            <p>*The following elements require additional consideration and so may not be the best choice as a base for your custom control: <code>input type="submit"</code> or <code>input type="image"</code>. For these elements, the onClick event can be triggered if a user presses enter anywhere within the form, or anywhere within the page if there are no <code>&lt;form&gt;</code> tags. (This won't happen, though, if the focus is on a natively active element, like a link, when the user presses Enter, which is why these elements are appropriate for use with typical forms.) Also, in some browsers, these elements automatically cause a page refresh. See <a href="#g10">PG 10</a> for tips on avoiding changing the user's place on a page unexpectedly.</p></li>
          <li>Or, you might use scripting to make an element that is not normally interactive into an interactive element. This requires considerable careful consideration for keyboard access. First, give the element a <code>tabindex="0"</code> attribute. This way, the element will be included in the natural tab order. And, be sure to follow the coding tips below. Unlike natively active elements, these items won't be keyboard accessible if you only use onClick and they may cause problems if there are submit buttons nearby:
            <ol class="pe-list.pe-styled-lists--ordered">
              <li> While browsers allow the keyboard to trigger <code>onclick</code> events for active elements, they typically do not allow the keyboard to trigger <code>onclick</code> events for elements that are not normally active. So, add an <code>onkeypress</code> event if needed. Be sure to code the <code>onkeypress</code> event so that it only triggers an action if the <strong>appropriate</strong> key is pressed (usually the enter key). See "When using <code>Onkeypress</code>, <code>Onkeydown</code>, or <code>Onkeyup</code>" below for more detail on the key-related events.</li>
              <li>Screen readers will not automatically know the purpose of the element. So, include text that is available to screen readers that indicates the purpose of the element and how to interact with it. (<a href="#g20">PG 20</a> explains further.) This is a case where testing the user experience with a screen reader is essential.</li>
              <li>Be sure this type of artificially active element never appears within a form that has a submit button (e.g. <code>input type="image"</code>, <code>input type="submit"</code>). When a user presses enter within a form, elements designed to submit the form will be triggered, including any <code>onClick</code> handlers on those elements. If there are no form tags, this will happen if enter is pressed anywhere on the page. The one exception is if a natively actively element (e.g. link, button) has focus at the time. This allows keyboard access users to use links and buttons within a form, but this exception does not apply if an active element was created using an element that is not normally active (e.g. <code>div</code>, <code>span</code>) . So, a keyboard access user will not be able to "click" on such custom elements, without triggering the form submit.</li>
              <li>In Firefox, <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> elements (without <code>href</code> attributes) that have been made active through scripting do not automatically gain focus indicators. See <a href="#g7">PG 7</a> for more on focus indicators and how to add them when needed.</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Selecting Particular Points</h4>
        <p>The HTML techniques for this PG explain that image maps can be keyboard accessible if you use <code>area</code> elements instead of using the x and y coordinates provided by <code>input type="image"</code> or <code>ismap</code>. For more complex JavaScript (or server-side) functionality where you would need 30, 40 or more <code>area</code> elements, though, <code>area</code> elements may not be appropriate as keyboard access users would have to tab through all of those <code>area</code> elements.</p>
        <p>In such cases, if you use the x and y coordinates provided by <code>input type="image"</code> or <code>ismap</code>, provide equivalent functionality for keyboard access users through buttons and controls. For example, if users need to plot points on a graph, you might provide text entry fields where the x and y coordinates of each point can be entered.</p>
        <p>Another option is using layers of elements if you detect that the user is using keyboard access. For example, at first the graph might be made up of four <code>input type="image"</code> elements. If any are clicked using the mouse, the x and y coordinates might be used. But if one is selected using the keyboard, it might be replaced by a set of 4 smaller area elements, and so on, until the keyboard user is able to select the particular point needed.</p>

        <h4>Clearing Default Text in a Form Field</h4>
        <p><mark>Do not clear user-entered text in form fields when focus is placed on the field. Screen reader users, in particular, may move backwards through the fields to check their entries just before submitting the form. If you write a script designed to clear the placeholder text, be sure to check the value of the text, and only clear the text if it really is just the placeholder text.</mark></p>
        <p>Another option is to use the HTML 5 <code>placeholder</code> attribute. If you support browsers where this is not implemented, you might use JavaScript for those browsers only. This article shows how to use JavaScript for browsers that don't support <code>placeholder</code> while still using clean HTML 5 tagging: <a href="http://webdesignerwall.com/tutorials/cross-browser-html5-placeholder-text" target="_blank">Open Web Designer Wall Article in a New Window</a>.</p>

        <h4>When using <code>Onkeypress</code>, <code>Onkeydown</code>, or <code>Onkeyup</code></h4>
        <p><code>Onkeypress</code>, <code>onkeydown</code> or <code>onkeyup</code> are triggered in some browsers by any key press at all, including key presses commonly used for keyboard access and screen reader navigation. For example, in some browsers, if a link opens a new window on key press, keyboard access users won't be able to tab past the link because focus will always move to the new window. When using natively active elements, <code>onclick</code> is sufficient for both mouse access and keyboard access as the Enter key fires the <code>onclick</code> event for keyboard access users. So, it is usually best to avoid using <code>onkeypress</code>, <code>onkeydown</code> or <code>onkeyup</code>. If you do use these, be sure:</p>
        <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
          <li>The functionality is purely decorative (inconsequential) and doesn't change focus.</li>
          <li>Or, you use JavaScript to ensure that actions only occur when particular keys are pressed and either:
            <ul>
              <li>You are only taking over the keys commonly used for ordinary components (arrow keys and enter) only when focus in on a custom control and the user can tab off of the custom control. (Note: to do this across browsers you need to use <code>onkeydown</code> instead of <code>onkeypress</code>.)</li>
              <li>You are taking over keys no matter where the user is on the page, but the functionality is not active by default. Instead, it is made active through user preferences. The users should be able to read which keys would be over-ridden. This way, they can avoid activating the functionality if the keys would interfere with their access method.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Android Applications</h3>
        <p>Android applications can be used with touch using <a href="https://support.google.com/accessibility/android/answer/6006598?rd=1">navigation gestures</a> and with a Bluetooth keyboard. It is recommended that interactive elements have a touch target of 48dp which is a physical size of about 9mm (for more information see <a href="https://material.io/guidelines/layout/metrics-keylines.html">Metrics and Grids</a>).</p>
        <p>The application works with touch and a Bluetooth keyboard when its <code>android:focusableattribute</code> to set to true. Android provides ways to control which controls are focusable using <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View.html#setFocusable(boolean)">setFocusable()</a> and <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View.html#isFocusable()">isFocusable()</a> and allows focus to be set to control using <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View.html#requestFocus()">requestFocus()</a>.</p>
        <p>The order in which controls receive focus is determined by the focus order which is based on an algorithm that finds the nearest neighbor in a given direction. This can be changed using <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View.html#attr_android:nextFocusDown">android:nextFocusDown</a>, <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View.html#attr_android:nextFocusLeft">android:nextFocusLeft</a>, <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View.html#attr_android:nextFocusRight">android:nextFocusRight</a>,and <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View.html#attr_android:nextFocusUp">android:nextFocusUp</a>. At runtime, the focus order can be changed using methods such as <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View.html#setNextFocusDownId(int)">setNextFocusDownId()</a> and <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View.html#setNextFocusRightId(int)">setNextFocusRightId()</a>.</p>
        <p>Touch events should only be triggered when touch is removed from the control and the ACTION:DOWN trigger should be avoided.</p>
        <p>For more information:</p>
        <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">

        </ul>

        <h3>iOS Applications</h3>
        <p>iOS applications allow users to use touch to navigate the screens and provides limited access through a Bluetooth keyboard unless VoiceOver is used in conjunction with the Bluetooth keyboard. For touch and gesture navigation, provide a minimum 44 X 44 point hit target area and avoid crowding the items too closely together. This will allow users to easily access a specific UI element.</p>
        <p>Standard interface elements are automatically touch accessible with and without the VoiceOver screen reader. Touch events should only be triggered when touch is removed from the control and the <code>touchesBegan:withEvent</code> should be avoided. Custom container and individual views must be made accessible in order for users to be able to interact with the interface elements.</p>

        <h4>How to make custom views accessible</h4>
        <p>There are two ways to make a custom individual view accessible:</p>
        <ol class="pe-list.pe-styled-lists--ordered">
          <li>Set the custom view's accessibility status in the code that instantiates it</li>
          <li>Implement the <code>isAccessibleElement</code> method of the <code>UIAccessibility</code> protocol in the custom subclass</li>
        </ol>
        <p>For custom container views, each interface element needs to be made accessible individually.  The container view should not be made accessible since users interact with the interface elements and not with the container itself.  To make container view interface elements accessible, implement the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/accessibility/uiaccessibilitycontainer">UIAccessibilityContainer</a> protocol.</p>

        <h3>PDF in Acrobat</h3>
        <p>Keyboard access in PDF is generally fine in Acrobat. Ensure that the tab order for active elements including links and form fields is correct.</p>
        <h4>Tab Order</h4>
        <p>The tab order in a PDF is determined by the page properties and the order of the tags in the tags tree. <br>
          <img width="285" height="257" src="images/page-properties.jpg" alt=""></p>
        <p>The location of the pages panel will vary depending on your version of Acrobat. In Acrobat 9 Pro, for example, you can find the panel at View &gt; Navigation Panels &gt; Pages. Select all the pages in the document. Select Page Properties in the navigation panel options menu and choose a tab order option. For tagged documents, always use "Use Document Structure" option.</p>

        <h3>PowerPoint</h3>
        <p>Keyboard access is controlled by PowerPoint. No special consideration is required within the content to make it accessible by keyboard. Verify that the reading order is correct so that users can navigate the content in the correct order.</p>
        <p>In PowerPoint, navigate with these keyboard shortcuts:</p>
        <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
          <li>Start slideshow - F5</li>
          <li>Next animation / slide - enter, page down, right or down arrow, spacebar</li>
          <li>Previous animation / slide - page up, up or left arrow</li>
          <li>Previous slide - P</li>
          <li>Go to slide in slideshow - type page number + enter</li>
        </ul>
        <p>When testing with JAWS, use these keyboard shortcuts to speak content:</p>
        <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
          <li>Next word - Insert + right arrow</li>
          <li>Next line - down arrow</li>
          <li>Next sentence - alt + down arrow</li>
          <li>Whole page - insert + down arrow</li>
          <li>Next list item - i</li>
          <li>Speak slower / faster - alt + ctrl + page down or page up</li>
        </ul>
 
        <h3>Flash &amp; Flex</h3>
        <p>In Flex, sometimes you'll find that the tab order does not match the reading order. To correct this, arrange the items in the source code so that they appear in the source code in the same order as your reading order.</p>

        <h4>508 Software § 1194.21 (a)</h4>
        <p>When software is designed to run on a system that has a keyboard, product functions shall be executable from a keyboard where the function itself or the result of performing a function can be discerned textually.</p>
        <h4>508 Web § 1194.22 (e)</h4>
        <p>Redundant text links shall be provided for each active region of a server-side image map.</p>

        <h4>WCAG 2.0 A - SC 2.1.1 Keyboard:</h4>
        <p>2.1.1 Keyboard: All functionality of the content is operable through a keyboard interface without requiring specific timings for individual keystrokes, except where the underlying function requires input that depends on the path of the user's movement and not just the endpoints. (Level A)</p>
        <p>Note 1: This exception relates to the underlying function, not the input technique. For example, if using handwriting to enter text, the input technique (handwriting) requires path-dependent input but the underlying function (text input) does not.</p>
        <p>Note 2: This does not forbid and should not discourage providing mouse input or other input methods in addition to keyboard operation.</p>
        <h4>WCAG 2.0 A – SC 2.1.2 No Keyboard Trap:</h4>
        <p>If keyboard focus can be moved to a component of the page using a keyboard interface, then focus can be moved away from that component using only a keyboard interface, and, if it requires more than unmodified arrow or tab keys or other standard exit methods, the user is advised of the method for moving focus away. (Level A)</p>
        <p>Note: Since any content that does not meet this success criterion can interfere with a user's ability to use the whole page, all content on the Web page (whether it is used to meet other success criteria or not) must meet this success criterion. See Conformance Requirement 5: Non-Interference.</p>
        <h4>WCAG 2.0 A – SC 2.4.3 Focus Order:</h4>
        <p>If a Web page can be navigated sequentially and the navigation sequences affect meaning or operation, focusable components receive focus in an order that preserves meaning and operability. (Level A)</p>

      <h2 id="g10">Guideline 10. Do not change the user's location on the screen unexpectedly (Continuity of  User's Place)</h2>
      <div class="guideline_content">
        <p class="summary">Do not change the user's location (e.g. place on the page, page/url, frame, window or user agent) as follows:</p>
        <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
          <li><strong>When the user moves to (on focus, on mouse over, on touch start) or away from (on blur, on mouse out, on touch end) any element including form control options</strong></li>
          <li>OR <strong>When the user changes the setting of a <abbr title="User Interface">UI</abbr> control, unless each option can be reached by the keyboard without selecting it and it is clear what will happen when the setting is changed</strong></li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Rationale</h3>
        <p>If the user's place in the media changes unexpectedly, it can be disorienting for any user and particularly disorienting for those with cognitive disabilities.</p>
        <p>For keyboard access users, such a change can also mean a significant amount of effort to get back to where they wished to be. As such, for these users, it is particularly frustrating if they cannot control when such changes take place.</p>
        <p>For screen reader users, such a change often means a change in the reading location. This can be confusing during an auditory experience. (Imagine your voice mail jumping from the middle of one message to the beginning of another message in the same person's voice.) For this reason, the user's place on the page should not change unexpectedly.</p>
        <p>Even if some user action triggers the change, the situation is little better if the change is unexpected or unavoidable. (Imagine your voice mail jumping from the middle of one message to the beginning of another message each time you move your mobile phone.)</p>
        <p>Warning or alert boxes that appear suddenly and suddenly gain focus are acceptable, if they are designed to interrupt activities for all users and are easy to dismiss. (Continuing with the voice mail analogy from above, the following message from your voice mail system wouldn't be confusing, after all: "Alert: The voice mail system will be down for the next fifteen minutes. Please call back after 12 pm.")</p>

        <h3>General Techniques</h3>
        <ol class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
          <li>If you change the user's place in the media in order to provide a warning or alert:
            <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
              <li><p>begin the message with text that identifies the message as a warning or alert</p>
                <p>~AND~</p></li>
              <li><p>provide a way to dismiss the message (For example, you might provide a "Close this Alert Box" button.)</p>
                <p>~AND~</p></li>
              <li>if possible, return the user to where they were on the page before the alert occurred.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>When hiding (removing) content that currently has focus, avoid an unexpected change in location by moving focus to some natural position just before or just after the dynamic content in the normal reading order.</li>
          <li>It is the user's perception of their location that is important in this guideline. As such, do not unexpectedly change the content around the user's location to such an extent that they would believe they are on a new page or in a new location on the page.</li>
        </ol>
 
        <h3>Technology Specifics</h3>
        <h4>HTML | XHTML | CSS | JavaScript</h4>
        <ol class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
          <li>Several of the techniques for <a href="#g6">Pearson Guideline 6</a> also speak to this issue.</li>
          <li>If you find that active elements are not in the ideal order when using the tab key to move through the page, correct this by adjusting reading order (see <a href="#g4">PG 4</a>). Do not use JavaScript to force particular changes in focus. For example, if you have three active elements on the page (A, B and C) that should be in that order, using JavaScript to move focus to C when B receives the blur event will violate this guideline. This would cause unexpected changes in focus as keyboard navigation must work both forwards (tab) and backwards (shift + tab). A user might trigger blur on B when moving backwards through the page, hoping to reach A, but this type of JavaScript would bring the user back to C.</li>

          <li>Spoken words</li>
          <li>Braille</li>
          <li>Large text</li>
          <li>Custom color-schemes</li>
          <li>Custom layouts</li>
        </ul>
        <p>When the structure of the default layout is created through visual settings alone, it is difficult for software to transform the structure into other forms. However, when elements in the structure are tagged with text or markup that says what they are (i.e. semantic markup), the structure can be carried over.</p>
        <p>For example, a typical visual Web user might use the indentations in a nested list to easily read only the top-level items first. To create parallel ease-of-use for screen reader users, the screen reader application must be able to identify the top-level list items. In HTML, list markup (e.g. <code>&lt;ol&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;li&gt;</code>) allows this with today's screen readers.</p>
        <p>Also, breaking up large blocks of text by marking them as headings, paragraphs, lists, etc helps all users to read the content more easily and is especially helpful for those with learning disabilities or cognitive impairments.</p>

        <h3>HTML &amp; JavaScript</h3>
       
        <h4>HTML | XHTML | CSS</h4>
        <p><strong>Where markup exists to define an element-type, use that markup for that type of element.</strong></p>
        <p>Examples:</p>

        <h4>Headings</h4>
        <p>When a Web Page includes headings, those headings should be marked up as HTML headings. HTML provides 6 levels of headings, which can be used to mark up heading text and to provide an outline structure for your page:</p>
<pre><code>
&lt;h1&gt;Happy Healthy Pets&lt;/h1&gt;
. . .
  &lt;h2&gt;Dogs&lt;/h2&gt;
  . . .
    &lt;h3&gt;Dog Health&lt;/h3&gt;
    . . .
    &lt;h3&gt;Dog Toys&lt;/h3&gt;
    . . .
  &lt;h2&gt;Cats&lt;/h2&gt;
  . . .
    &lt;h3&gt;Cat Health&lt;/h3&gt;
    . . .
    &lt;h3&gt;Cat Toys&lt;/h3&gt;
    . . .</code></pre>
        <p>If needed, use CSS to adjust the appearance of HTML headings:</p>
<pre><code>
h1 {
  /* choose a good font size */
  font-size: large;
  /* Headings don't have to be bold */
  font-weight: normal;
  /* remove all that extra space */
  padding: 0;
  margin: 0;
  /* add back just the space you want */
  margin-top: 13px;
  /* add any other formatting you like */
  text-align: center;
}</code></pre>
        <p>If necessary for visual effects, you can also use an image within a heading tag. (See <a href="#g21">PG 21</a> regarding images of text.)</p>
<pre><code>
&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;img src="sea_mammals.gif" alt="Mammals of the Sea"&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;</code></pre>
        <p><mark><strong>redundant, this is guideline 11</strong> But, don't use heading tags like <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> for the headers inside tables. See Pearson Guideline 11 for the correct semantic markup for tables.</mark></p>

        <h4>Lists (Definition Lists, Ordered Lists and Unordered Lists)</h4>
        <p>When a Web page includes a list, the list should be marked up as an HTML list:</p>
<pre><code>
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Chapter One
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Activity One&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Activity Two&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Chapter Two
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Activity One&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Activity Two&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</code></pre>
        <p>If needed, use CSS to adjust the appearance of HTML lists:</p>
<pre><code>
body &gt; ul {
  /* remove bullets from first-level list directly inside body tag */
  list-style-type: none;
}
body &gt; ul &gt; li {
  /* adjust space between first-level list items */
  margin-bottom: 20px;
  /* Enclose each first-level list item in a box */
  border-style: solid;
  border-width: 1px;
  width: 15em;
  padding: .5em;
}
body &gt; ul &gt; li &gt; ul {
  /* adjust how far second-level items are indented */
  margin-left: 2em;
  padding-left: 2em;
  /* choose a bullet for second-level list items */
  list-style-type: square;
}
/* child selector (&gt;) does not work in IE 6 - 
   use class names if you need to support IE 6 */</code></pre>
        <p><a href="list_css_by_child_selector.html" target="_blank">List CSS Sample Page (New Window)</a>.</p>

        <h4>Tables and Table Headers</h4>
        <p>Header cells for data tables should be marked up using <code>&lt;th&gt;</code> tags and data cells should be marked up using <code>&lt;td&gt;</code> tags. If a cell is both a header cell and a data cell, use <code>&lt;td&gt;</code> tags. (Additional mark-up, described below, will further clarify the purpose of the cell.</p>
        <p>For data tables either <code>scope</code> attributes or <code>id</code> and <code>headers</code> attributes should associate header cells with data cells.</p>
        <p>The <code>scope</code> attribute is easiest way to associate header cells with data cells. When a cell is column header use <code>scope="col"</code> and when the cell is a row header use <code>scope="row"</code>:</p>
<pre><code>
&lt;table border="1"&gt;
  &lt;caption&gt;Average Park Use in 2008&lt;/caption&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;th scope="col"&gt;People&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th scope="col"&gt;Dogs&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th scope="col"&gt;Other Pets&lt;/th&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;th scope="row"&gt;Monday&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;52&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;30&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;th scope="row"&gt;Tuesday&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;40&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;23&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;0&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  . . .
&lt;/table&gt;</code></pre>
        <p>Table Scope Attribute Sample Page: <a href="table_scope_attributes.html">This Window</a> | <a href="table_scope_attributes.html" target="_blank">New Window</a>.</p>
        <p>If a data table is so complex that <code>scope</code> attributes are not sufficient to associate header cells with data cells, simplify the table or break it into a number of simpler tables. If that is not possible, use <code>headers</code> and <code>id</code> attributes to associate header cells with data cells: Assign an <code>id</code> attribute to each header cell. Then give each data cell a <code>headers</code> attribute. The value of the <code>headers</code> attribute should be a space-delimited list of the ids the data cell's headers, as shown below:</p>
<pre><code>
&lt;table . . . &gt;
  &lt;caption&gt;Average Park Use in 2009&lt;/caption&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;th rowspan="2"&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th colspan="2" id="p"&gt;People&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th colspan="2" id="d"&gt;Dogs&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th colspan="3" id="o"&gt;Other Pets&lt;/th&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;th id="adult"&gt;Adults&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th id="child"&gt;Children&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th id="toy"&gt;Toy Dogs&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th id="od"&gt;Other Dogs&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th id="mam"&gt;Mammals&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th id="birds"&gt;Birds&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th id="rep"&gt;Reptiles&lt;/th&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;th id="M"&gt;Monday&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;td headers="adult M"&gt;52&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td headers="child M"&gt;30&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td headers="toy M"&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td headers="od M"&gt;52&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td headers="mam M"&gt;30&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td headers="birds M"&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td headers="rep M"&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;th id="Tu"&gt;Tuesday&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;td headers="adult Tu"&gt;65&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td headers="child Tu"&gt;31&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td headers="toy Tu"&gt;8&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td headers="od Tu"&gt;54&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td headers="mam Tu"&gt;40&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td headers="birds Tu"&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td headers="rep Tu"&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  . . .

        <p><strong>Do not use semantic tags for visual effects that are not consistent with the meaning of the tag.</strong></p>
        <p>For example, do not use <code>&lt;blockquote&gt;</code> to indent text when the text is not a quotation. And, do not use definition lists for items that are not definitions.</p>

        <h4>Legacy HTML</h4>
        <p>If you use table markup for layout (rather than for tabular data), use only <code>&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;td&gt;</code> without any semantic markup (<code>&lt;th&gt;</code>, <code>scope</code>, <code>headers</code>, <code>&lt;caption&gt;</code>, <code>summary</code>). Add <code>role="presentation"</code> to the opening <code>&lt;table&gt;</code> tag for layout tables to prevent screen readers from announcing the tables.</p>
        <p>Note: Unless the targeted user agents cannot support the desired layout in CSS, new content should not use tables for layout as they are not semantically correct. However, because layout tables were used so extensively, current assistive technology has been adapted for them. So, legacy content may use layout tables without significantly degrading the experience for users with disabilities. (As layout tables disappear from the Web, future assistive technologies  may not handle layout tables well.)</p>

        <h4>JavaScript</h4>
        <ol class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--ordered">
          <li>When adding content using JS, include correct semantic mark-up.</li>
          <li>When adding content to the Document Object Model, use nodes that describe the content semantically:
<pre><code>
function addNews() {   
  /* create a heading */
  var myH = document.createElement("h3");

  /* create a text node */
  var myHT = document.createTextNode("Author is Online");

  /* place text node into the heading element */
  myH.appendChild(myHT);

  /* place heading element on the page */
  document.body.appendChild(myH);

  /* do the same for a paragraph of text */
  var myP = document.createElement("p");
  var myPT = document.createTextNode("To chat with ...");
  myP.appendChild(myPT);
  document.body.appendChild(myP);
}</code></pre>
          </li>
        </ol>
 
        <h3>Android Applications</h3>
        <p>User interface elements should be used in accordance with their intended purpose.  Wherever possible use standard UI elements as these will automatically convey the element role.</p>
        <p><mark>Note: Android 5.0 and below does not currently provide semantic markup for headings.</mark></p>

        <h3>iOS Applications</h3>
        <p>User interface elements should be used in accordance with their intended purpose.  Wherever possible use standard UI elements as these will be automatically updated when the iOS changes and they contain the framework to make UI elements fully accessible.</p>
        <p>The <code>UIAccessibility</code> informal protocol provides information about the type of user interface control. The <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/objectivec/nsobject/1615202-accessibilitytraits">accessibilityTraits property</a> is used to define the element semantics. An element on the page can have more than one trait. The following traits can be used:</p>
        <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
          <li><code>UIAccessibilityTraitButton</code> - button element</li>
          <li><code>UIAccessibilityTraitLink</code> - link</li>
          <li><code>UIAccessibilityTraitSearchField</code> - search field</li>
          <li><code>UIAccessibilityTraitImage</code> - image</li>
          <li><code>UIAccessibilityTraitStaticText</code> - element is treated as static text and cannot be changed</li>
          <li><code>UIAccessibilityTraitHeader</code> - heading</li>
        </ul> 

        <h3>PDF in Acrobat</h3>
        <p>Acrobat supports creating tags for any content within your PDF without changing the visual appearance of the PDF. The tools to use for this are the TouchUp Reading Order Tool (TURO) and the Tags Panel. The location of the Tags Panel and TURO will vary depending on your version of Acrobat. <mark>In Acrobat 9 Pro, for example, you can find the Tags Panel at View &gt; Navigation Panels &gt; Tags and TURO is at Advanced &gt; Accessibility &gt; TouchUp Reading Order or Alt + AAT. In version X they are under the Tools menu.</mark></p>
        <p>If the document is simple and the tags do not already exist in the PDF, it is easiest to begin with Acrobat's automatic tagging (Advanced &gt; Accessibility &gt; Add tags to document) and then manually adjust any tags that are not semantically correct. For more complex pages use Acrobat's Tags Panel or TURO to add tags.</p>

        <h4>PDF Tags</h4>
        <p>Semantic markup is created using tags. In order for your document to be correctly interpreted by assistive devices, the correct tags need to be defined.</p>
        <p>The common PDF tags include:</p>
        <table class="pe-table">
          <thead>
            <tr>

        <p>Sometimes tags will appear in the tags tree that are different than the defined standard tag names used by Adobe Acrobat. These are defined by the authoring software tool. For example, Microsoft Word often uses the tag Normal instead of &lt;P&gt; for paragraphs.</p>
        <p><strong>Role mapping</strong> is a function that is mainly used with authoring software tools to map these non-standard tags to the standard Adobe Acrobat tags. If the tag is mapped to a standard tag name then you do not need to change the tag names in the tags tree.</p>
        <p>To view the list of role map items by selecting Edit Role Map in the Tags navigation panel options. If any of the role mappings are incorrect, edit the item. If a tag does not appear in this list, you can manually add it using the functions in this window.<br>
        <img src="images/role-map.jpg" width="328" height="369" alt=""></p>

        <h4>Headings</h4>

        <h5>Document Title</h5>
        <p>The main document title should be labeled using the tag. Typically this is shown on the cover or the first page of the document. This tag should only be used once in the document.</p>

        <h5>Section Headings</h5>
        <p>When a document includes section headings, those headings should be defined as heading tags. Adobe Acrobat provides 6 levels of headings which can be used define the hierarchy of headings and sub-headings in the document.</p>

        <h5>Image Section Headings</h5>
        <p>If an image is the heading for the section, tag the image as a heading. Add a new tag for the heading at the appropriate level and then add the &lt;Figure&gt; tag as a child of the heading tag.</p>
        
        <h4>Lists</h4>
        <p>If the document uses a list, the list should be marked up using list tags (&lt;L&gt; and &lt;LI&gt;). The &lt;LI&gt; tags should be grouped as children of a list (&lt;L&gt;) tag.<br>
          <img src="images/simple-list.jpg" width="264" height="248" alt="Common list structure is L tag with children LI tags. Typically under the LI tag is either the content, P tag with content or LBody tag."></p>

        <h5>Tip:</h5>
        <p>Sometimes you may see &lt;LBody&gt; present in the tags tree. This tag is not used by screen readers and is not necessary. If they are present, they can be kept but there is no need to manually add them.</p>

        <h5>Unordered Lists</h5>
        <p>Unordered lists will often include the bullet character within the list item &lt;LI&gt; tag. To tell screen readers to ignore this character, select the bullet and change it to background content using TURO. This will artifact the tag and it will no longer show up in the tags tree.</p>

        <h5>Ordered Lists</h5>
        <p>Ordered lists are defined in the same way as unordered lists. However, the numbers within the list text needs to be part of the &lt;LI&gt; tag and should not be set to background text.<br>
          <img src="images/ordered-list.jpg" width="270" height="213" alt=""></p>

        <h5>Nested Lists</h5>
        <p>To nest lists, add the &lt;L&gt; tag as a child to the &lt;LI&gt; of the parent list. The structure could look something like this:<br>
          <img src="images/list-structure.jpg" width="266" height="256" alt="The &lt;L&gt; tag has 4 &lt;LI&gt;.  Under one of the &lt;LI&gt; is a sublist. The sublist &lt;L&gt; is a child of the &lt;LI&gt;"></p>

        <h4>Paragraphs</h4>
        <p>All text that is not a heading or cannot be tagged with another tag should be defined as a paragraph (&lt;P&gt;) tag. This includes introductory paragraphs, abstracts and text that are highlighted graphically.</p>
        <p>Sometimes paragraphs are defined using non-standard tag names. These may be mapped using the Role Mapping and would act like a paragraph. Check the role mapping before reassigning the tag as these may not need to be changed.</p>
        
        <h5>Content that spans multiple pages</h5>
        <p>If text straddles two or more pages, the text should be combined into a single paragraph tag. To combine two tags, select and expand each tag in the tags panel to show their text containers. Drag one to combine the two containers under one tag, and then delete the remaining, empty tag. The same situation can occur with lists, tables, and tables of content but they tend to be easier to identify because their parent tag repeats.</p>
        <p>Multiple tables are often caused intentionally by the content author. For screen reader users it is best to combine them into one table with one column header row.</p>

        <h4>Tables</h4>
        <img src="images/table-tag-structure.jpg" style="float:right;" width="137" height="276" alt="">
        <p>Tables need to be structured in a way that helps users who cannot see the screen understand the relationship of the data in the cells. The following table tags should be used:</p>
        <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
          <li>Table row (&lt;TR&gt;) to define each row of table cells</li>
          <li>Table headers (&lt;TH&gt;) for table header cells</li>
          <li>Table data (&lt;TD&gt;) for table data cells</li>
        </ul>

        <h5 style="clear:both;">Table Headers</h5>
        <p>Both row and column headers can be defined using the table header (&lt;TH&gt;) tag and scope to define whether or not a cell is a column or row header.</p>
        <p>The easiest way to set the scope of a header cell is using the table editor.<br>
          <img src="images/table-cell-properties.jpg" width="346" height="114" alt=""></p> 
        <p>In the properties, set the type to header cell and the scope to the appropriate value. The scope property can have the following values:</p>
        <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
          <li>Row – for row headers</li>
          <li>Column – for column headers</li>
          <li>Both – for cells that are both a row header and a column header</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If the table has complex headers and the scope attributes are not sufficient to associate header cells with data cells, you will need to use header IDs. This usually happens when you have a header cell that spans multiple columns and only applies to some of the cells below.</p>
        <p>To assign to headers and IDs to the table cells, first define the cell as a &lt;TH&gt; then give the header cell an ID. Make sure that the scope is set to NONE. Then for each data cell, assign the associate header cell IDs.<br>
          <img src="images/header-complex-properties.jpg" width="347" height="357" alt="In the table cell properties dialog, set the type radio button to header cell. The scope should be set to none. In the attribute section, type in a value in the ID textbox."></p>

        <h5>Screen Reader Tips:</h5>
        <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
          <li><mark>JAWS 12 will only read column header. Row headers are ignored. This is a bug in JAWS.</mark></li>
          <li>Screen readers read the header ids starting with the column header and then the row headers. The order displayed in the Associated Header Cells IDs list does not matter.</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>Spanning Cells</h5>
        <p>If a cell spans two or more rows or columns should use RowSpan and ColSpan attribute to define the number of rows or columns that the cell spans. The easiest way to do this is to use TURO and the Table Editor. In the cell context menu select Table Editor. This will show the table structure on the page. In the cell that spans multiple cells, right-click and select Table Cell Properties. In this dialog, set the row or column span to the number of cells spanned.</p>

        <h5>Blank Cells</h5>
        <p>If your table has blanks cells, these may not be automatically defined in the table tags. If there are blank cells that are present but there is no tag in the tags tree, add an empty &lt;TD&gt; tag so that the row or column has the same number of cells as the other rows.</p>
 
        <h3>Word</h3>
        <p>When formatting is used to convey special meaning to content, be sure to use the built-in Word styles and features as much as possible to maximize accessibility. For example, use styles for emphasized content, lists, tables, heading, headers, and footers. Conversely, when those styles and features are used, ensure that they are used to convey particular meaning or organization of content and not simply used because the visual appearance matches a desired look.</p>

        <h4>Headings</h4>
        <p>Define all headings using Word heading styles. Modify the Word heading styles to change the font, color and other style elements (see <a href="#g9">PG 9 In Page Navigation</a> for more information on headings).</p>
        <p>Avoid creating a new Word style for headings as this will not be defined as a heading even it is defined as style that is based on a heading.</p>
        <p>Word styles should not be misused or used just for visual appearance of the formatting.</p>

        <h4>Lists</h4>
        <p>The toolbar options in Home &gt; Paragraph for unordered (bullet) and ordered (numbered) lists automatically apply list styles. Other styles are available in the styles window for indented lists, and using indent or tab automatically applies them.</p>
        <p>Avoid using empty list items for spacing. Instead, apply paragraph spacing on individual lines as necessary. Do not simulate lists with direct formatting. Use Word styles.</p>

        <h4>Tables</h4>
        <p>Use Word built-in tables to present tabular content and data. Do not simulate tables with white space (adding spaces and tabs or using columns) or use draw table functions in Word as they will not provide the semantic table structure.</p>
        <p>In the table properties, set the following options:<br>
          <img src="images/table-properties.jpg" width="433" height="238" alt=""></p>
        <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
          <li>Allow row to break across pages should not be checked</li>
          <li>If the table has column headers, select the top row and set check the heading row should repeat across pages checkbox</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Avoid empty table rows and splitting content into multiple tables as this will make the table harder to understand.</p>
        <p>Note: There is no way to explicitly set row and column headers in Word.</p>
  
        <h4>Paragraphs</h4>
        <p>Use paragraph spacing for layout rather than adding extra blank paragraphs. Think of Word paragraphs as containers of content, not as the return key on a typewriter. All paragraph containers should have content otherwise JAWS will announce them as blank.</p>

        <h4>Drop Caps</h4>
        <p>Do not use Word's drop caps feature. The letters are set up as text boxes, which are not read by screen readers.</p>

        <h4>Header / Footer</h4>
        <p>Use the Word built-in feature rather than simulating them. They are not read by screen readers so make sure that any important information is also included once in the overall document content.</p>

        <h4>Styles</h4>
        <p>Choose styles over direct formatting as much as possible. Though the use of character styles such as emphasis and strong is encouraged for ease of document consistency and maintenance, at this time screen readers do not announce them.</p>
        <p>However, consider incorporating character styles in your approach anyway for the benefit for document maintenance. As a general best practice, avoid creating many variations of styles when a small set will work. Name the styles for the content that they represent and how they should be used rather than for their appearance, e.g. "Term definition" rather than "bold 15 before 10 after". This will simplify the conversion to PDF.</p>

        <h3>PowerPoint</h3>
        <p>Use the built-in PowerPoint elements. For example, use the numbered and bulleted list options on the Home tab, and use Title containers. Empty content such as lists and paragraphs can confuse screen reader users when they navigate by paragraphs or when lists are announced with the wrong number of elements. Fragmented content can also be confusing when it is spoken. Look for situations where lines are broken up to wrap around objects. Overall, try to use the appropriate content layout, indentation, and paragraph spacing for visual alignment, rather than tabs, paragraphs, and spaces.</p>
        
        <h4>Special Content</h4>
        <p>Some special content is not accessible in PowerPoint. Embedded Excel charts and tables, and Word documents are visible and accessible in edit mode, e.g. the "normal presentation view". Users can navigate to the object and interact with it. However, in slideshow mode, they cannot interact with the object to view data, text, or graph elements. Excel data pasted "as HTML" can be accessible. Consider replacing Word content and Excel data with normal PowerPoint content holders, tables with PowerPoint tables, and graphs with PowerPoint graphs or screenshot pictures.</p>

        <h4>Multimedia</h4>
        <p>Audio, video, and Flash movies should contain captions, textual descriptions, or spoken descriptions as appropriate. </p>
        <p><mark>Note: PowerPoint 2010 includes a new tool, Sub-titling Text Add-in for Microsoft PowerPoint (STAMP) that allows you to add captions to video and audio, or import Timed Text Markup caption files from within PowerPoint.</mark></p>
        <p>Interactive Flash content can be difficult to make accessible. Be sure to test it using a screen reader to make sure that you can tab to the control to activate it, interact with it using the keyboard, and hear the appropriate content from the screen reader.</p>

        <h3>Excel</h3>
        <p>Microsoft Excel has a built-in function that can be used to give names to a cell or a range of cells. Screen readers look for certain specific names to identify which cells contain row and column titles.</p>
        <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
          <li>To create both row and column headers, move to the intersection of the row and column titles and add the name to the cell using the "Define Name" option in the context menu (right click or shift+F10). Set the name to Title (one word with mixed case).</li>
          <li>To create just row headers, navigate to the column containing the titles and open the Define Name dialog box. Set the name to RowTitle (one word with mixed case and no spaces).</li>
          <li>To create just column headers, navigate to the column containing the titles and open the Define Name dialog box. Set the name to ColumnTitle (one word with mixed case and no spaces).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>NOTE: These procedures can also be used when column titles span multiple rows or when row titles span multiple columns. When the column titles span multiple rows, select all of the rows before creating the ColumnTitle definition. When the row titles span multiple columns, select all of the columns before creating the RowTitle definition.</p>

        <h3>Testing HTML</h3>
        <p>Semantic markup includes heading markup. But testing for heading markup is not included here as it is included under <a href="#g9">Pearson Guideline 9</a> on in-page navigation.</p>

If these are marked up as separate unordered lists, the distinction between the groups of links will be clear to a blind user too.</p></td>

Layout tables should not have these access attributes. If tables are used for layout, see if the tables have <code>role="presentation"</code> set. If not, this is an error for newly developed pages.</p>
                <p>If there are simple data tables, be sure that row and column headers are specified. This can be done by using <code>th</code> or <code>scope</code> on each header cell. If the top-left corner cell is a header cell, it must have a <code>scope</code> attribute to say whether it is a row or column header. More complex data tables may have many cells that need clarification of their scope using the scope tag. Data tables can also be marked up with <code>headers</code>/<code>id</code> combinations, where every header cell has an <code>id</code> and every data cell has a <code>headers</code> attribute listing (space delimited) the <code>id</code>s of its header cells.</p>
                <p>Note: If the page is being edited, we recommend using both <code>th</code> and <code>scope</code> on every header cell and <code>td</code> with <code>scope</code> for cells that are both data cells and headers cells.
