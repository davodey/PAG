      <h2 id="g1">Guideline 1. Choose technologies (e.g. HTML vs. Flash) with accessibility in mind (Choosing Technologies)</h2>
      <div class="guideline_content">
        <p class="summary">When choosing a document type or a user interface technology (e.g. HTML, Flash, Flex, PDF, mobile application), choose the most accessible technology that can accomplish project requirements.</p>
 
        <h3>Rationale</h3>
        <p>Some media types have a much higher potential for accessibility than others.</p>
        <p>Even when two media types can each produce accessible results, choosing the most accessible technology will facilitate the process of making your product accessible.</p>

        <h3>HTML's Potential</h3>
        <p>HTML and XHTML have the highest potential for accessibility of any document type available today.</p>
        <p>HTML and XHTML provide access on multiple platforms and multiple browsers and work well with a wide variety of assistive technologies. (In this context, assistive technology is software and hardware that is used by people with disabilities to facilitate access to media.)</p>
        <p>HTML accessibility has been studied and refined for over 14 years and users of assistive technologies are typically comfortable working with HTML and XHTML.</p>
        <p>When coded with accessibility in mind, this media type gives users with disabilities:</p>
        <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
          <li>A choice of device, operating system and browser</li>
          <li>Access to all information presented</li>
          <li>The ability to use all controls</li>
          <li>The ability to skim the page for information without reading through the entire page</li>
          <li>Access to detailed text alternatives for complex images and also the ability to choose when and if to read those detailed text alternatives</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Added Benefits: HTML and XHTML are highly accessible because they are highly transformable and in widespread use. These qualities also make your content easy to reuse, to update and to transform for use with new technologies.
 
        <h3>JavaScripts's Potential</h3>
        <p>Including JavaScript in your HTML and XHTML media does not decrease the potential for accessibility. However, significant use of JavaScript introduces additional concerns that need to be addressed, primarily:</p>
        <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
          <li>Notifying users who do not see the screen or who do not see the entire screen of changes to the screen</li>
          <li>Making sure scripts work well when people use only a keyboard (no mouse) to navigate</li>
          <li>Designing custom user interfaces components so that they work for users who experience the page after it has been transformed for their needs (e.g. transformed into an auditory form for people with visual impairment)</li>
          <li>Rejecting inaccessible JavaScript libraries</li>
          <li>Ensuring that changes to the screen are properly recognized by assistive technology.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>While JavaScript's association with (X)HTML gives it a high potential for accessibility, as with any programming language, user interface functionality written in JavaScript requires testing. This should include testing with:</p>
        <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
          <li>Screen Readers (See <a href="#g4">PG 4</a>)</li>
          <li>Keyboard-only Access (See <a href="#g6">PG 6</a>)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This testing is easy to perform and provides experience with the types of user interfaces that we can expect for all users in emerging and future technologies.</p>
        <p>Note: Unless otherwise indicated, when JavaScript is mentioned in this document, it means JavaScript that runs within HTML or XHTML pages on the client-side.</p>

        <h3>PDF's Potential</h3>
        <p>Some PDF files are simply images of a document, without any real text, like a photo of a page in a book. While these files often allow users to zoom in on the document for easier reading, the documents are largely inaccessible to people with visual impairment.</p>
        <p>However, since PDF Version 1.4, it has been possible create documents that are compatible with assistive technologies, like screen readers, by placing a structure of tags, very similar to HTML tags, behind a PDF document:<br>
          <img src="images/pdf_tags.png" width="359" height="293" alt="The tags panel presents a hierarchy of tags that describe the structure of a PDF document, including Sect, Title, Heading 1, P, and Figure."></p>

        <p>As in HTML, it is possible even to make very detailed accommodations for accessibility, such as semantic mark up for complex data tables, including special attributes for telling screen readers exactly which data cells should be associated which header cells. When you use these tags and follow accessibility guidelines, PDF can be highly accessible with screen readers and can be keyboard accessible.</p>
        <p>Abobe Reader offers an array of features for text resize, magnification, and adjusting text colors. These work well for simple clean documents, but not very well for complex documents with multiple columns and boxes of text. While in HTML, users can apply custom style sheets to separately customize the appearance of different types of items (headings, lists etc) this is not possible in PDF with Adobe Reader as of <mark>Version 10.1</mark>.</p>
        <p>There are automated tools that help transform inaccessible PDF documents (even those that are just images of documents) into tagged PDF files. To fully take advantage of PDF's accessibility features, human review is required and most often PDF documents need post processing in Adobe Acrobat (version 6 or later). For complex documents with, for example, data tables, lists and links, this post-processing can be time-consuming.</p>
        <p>If the document originates in another program, such as Microsoft Word, following best practices in that program (like using heading styles and lists properly) can:</p>
        <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
          <li>Result in passably accessible documents in some simple cases
          <li>Reduce the amount of post-processing need in Acrobat
        </ul>

        <h4>Screen Reader Compatibility</h4>
        <p>Screen reader compatibility is available on Mac (VoiceOver) and Windows (JAWS, NVDA, <mark>WindowEyes</mark>). <mark>Access to the tagging structure is not available when reading PDF on iOS. On Android, you need to download special players to even access the speech using TalkBack. But, iOS and Android accessibility is improving rapidly, so it this may improve soon.</mark></p>

        <h4>Documentation for PDF accessibility</h4>
        <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
          <li>The Pearson Guidelines include PDF techniques.
          <li><a href="http://www.adobe.com/accessibility/products/acrobat/training.html">Adobe offers Guidance Specific to recent versions of Acrobat (8-11)</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/pdf.html">The W3C has published techniques for meeting WCAG 2.0 while creating PDF</a></li>
        </ul>
 
        <h3><mark>Flash and Flex's Potential</mark></h3>
        <p>Flash and Flex can be accessible, but it will not happen by accident, by checking "make movie accessible" in the Flash Authoring tool, or by including alternative text in an HTML embed tag. Like HTML, Flash / Flex accessibility requires specific detailed consideration during development.</p>
        <p>Flash and Flex accessibility techniques are considerably less widely known among developers compared with HTML accessibility techniques. As such, accessible Flash is not likely to come from a vendor who does not have specific experience developing accessible Rich Internet Applications.</p>
        <p>If you do want to work with a vendor who does not have accessibility experience, provide the following:</p>
        <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
          <li>Detailed Requirements for Flash Accessibility</li>
          <li>Accessibility Acceptance Testing (Make it clear upfront that you will not accept builds that don't include accessibility features for the functionality that is present. All too often developers attempt to tack-on accessibility at the end of the project, which typically results in a poor level of accessibility or causes accessibility to be perpetually pushed to a later release. Flash accessibility is not a separate feature to be developed independently of other functionality. While it can often be added after the fact, that actually involves revisiting and adapting objects and functionality and takes longer than including accessibility upfront. Flash developers who know how to accomplish Flash Accessibility include accessibility during development. Leaving it for later increases cost, increases schedule time and is a good sign that the vendor does not quite know how to accomplish accessibility in Flash.)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The easier option is to use a vendor who has experience with Accessible Rich Internet Applications. The effort it takes to find and choose a vendor who has accessibility experience, is likely to pay off in other ways, as writing accessible Flash and Flex requires a professional understanding of Flash or Flex and often involves understanding, using, and even rewriting libraries.</p>
        <p>It has been possible to create accessible Flash applications since Flash MX and the Flash Player 6; however, as implementing accessibility features targeted for the Flash Player 8+ has drastically reduced development time, these guidelines will provide techniques targeting Flash Player 8+.</p>
        <p>Some effort has been made to support accessible Flash in Firefox and some online sources indicate that Flash is accessible in Firefox. However, as of March 2009, the support is not stable. So, currently, Flash accessibility for screen reader users requires Internet Explorer on Windows. Since this is the platform support by the screen readers that are used by the vast majority of screen reader users, JAWS and Window-Eyes, this is not as problematic as it may seem at first.</p>
        <p>As with any programming language, user interface functionality written in ActionScript requires testing. This should include testing with:</p>
        <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
          <li>Screen Readers (See PG 4)</li>
          <li>Keyboard-only Access (See PG 6)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This testing is easy to perform and provides experience with the types of user interfaces that we can expect for all users in emerging and future technologies.</p>

        <h3>Android Applications's Potential</h3>
        <p>Android applications developed using Android 4.1 and later can be made accessible with the Android development framework. For more information on developing accessible Android applications see <a href="https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/accessibility/index.html">Android Accessibility API Guide</a>.</p>
        <p>With each new release of Android, new features to help users with disabilities are added. These features and settings can be found under the settings in the Accessibility option. Since the operating system can be changed by the device manufacture, some features may or may not be available on all devices. In Android Lollipop, the following features are available:</p>
        <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
          <li>Talkback and Explore by Touch</li>
          <li>Switch Access</li>
          <li>Just Speak</li>
          <li>Captions</li>
          <li>Magnification Gestures</li>
          <li>Large Text</li>
          <li>High Contract Text</li>
          <li>Accessibility Shortcut</li>
          <li>Touch &amp; Hold Delay</li>
          <li>Color Inversion</li>
          <li>Color Correction</li>
        </ul>
        <p>While Android application programming interface supports accessibility, as with any programming language, user interface written for Android requires testing. This should include testing with:</p>
        <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
          <li>Talkback and Explore by Touch</li>
          <li>Screen magnification and text resize settings</li>
          <li>Bluetooth keyboard, touch, and gestures</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>iOS Applications's Potential</h3>
        <p>All iOS applications developed using iOS 3.0 and later can be made accessible with the UI Accessibility programming interface. For more information on developing accessible iOS applications see Accessibility Programming Guide for iOS.</p>
        <p>With each new release of iOS, new features to help users with disabilities are added. These features and settings can be found under the General settings under Accessibility option. In iOS8, the following features are available:</p>
        <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
          <li>VoiceOver screen reader</li>
          <li>Zoom</li>
          <li>Invert Colors</li>
          <li>Greyscale</li>
          <li>Speech</li>
          <li>Larger Text</li>
          <li>Bold Text</li>
          <li>Button Shapes</li>
          <li>Increase Contrast</li>
          <li>Reduce Motion</li>
          <li>On/Off Labels</li>
          <li>LED flash for alerts</li>

          <li>Reachability</li>
          <li>Accessibility Shortcut</li>
        </ul>
        <p>While iOS application programming interface supports accessibility, as with any programming language, user interface written for iOS requires testing. This should include testing with:</p>
        <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
          <li>VoiceOver Screen Reader</li>
          <li>Screen magnification and text size settings</li>

      </div>

      <h2 id="g2">Guideline 2. Allow users to adjust time limits (Time Limits)</h2>
      <div class="guideline_content">
        <p class="summary">Allow users to adjust short-term (20 hours or less) time limits to at least ten times the default.</p>
        <p>Note: If this would invalidate a timed activity, see <a href="#g3">Pearson Guideline 3</a>.</p>

        <h3>Rationale</h3>
        <p>Some users will need more time to complete activities than the average user. They may have a learning disability that causes reading or processing of information to take longer. Or, they may have a physical disability that slows access to the product.</p>
        <p>A time limit that causes a user to lose work or to return to the login page may create a frustrating cycle that prevents the user from completing the activity.</p>
        <p>"Twenty hours or less" and "ten times the default" were chosen based on the WCAG 2.0 guidelines, which were developed based on clinical research.</p>

        <h3>Techniques</h3>
        <p>Options Quoted from WCAG 2.0 (SC 2.2.1)</p>
        <blockquote><ul>
          <li>Turn off: The user is allowed to turn off the time limit before encountering it; or</li>
          <li>Adjust: The user is allowed to adjust the time limit before encountering it over a wide range that is at least ten times the length of the default setting; or</li>
          <li>Extend: The user is warned before time expires and given at least 20 seconds to extend the time limit with a simple action (for example, 'press the space bar'), and the user is allowed to extend the time limit at least ten times;</li>
        </ul></blockquote>
 
        <h3>K-3 Techniques</h3>
        <p>Students in the earliest grades may not be able to judge how much time they will need. A solution to this is to measure the student's ability to respond to a prompt or to activate a button through an introductory activity. Then, automatically adjust the timing for the main activity based on that data. This requires user-testing. Controls to further adjust timing should still be made available.</p>

Turn off: the user is allowed to turn off the time limit before encountering it; or
Adjust: the user is allowed to adjust the time limit before encountering it over a wide range that is at least ten times the length of the default setting; or
Extend: the user is warned before time expires and given at least 20 seconds to extend the time limit with a simple action (for example, "hit any key"), and the user is allowed to extend the time limit at least ten times.
There are three exceptions:
Real-time Exception: the time limit is a required part of a real-time event (for example, an auction), and no alternative to the time limit is possible; or
Essential Exception: the time limit is part of an activity where timing is essential and time limits cannot be extended further without invalidating the activity.
20 Hour Exception: the time limit is longer than 20 hours.</mark></p>

      <div class="guideline_content">
        <p class="summary">If Pearson Guideline 2 would invalidate a timed activity:</p>
        <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
          <li><strong>Allow instructors or administrators to adjust time limits for particular students</strong></li>
          <li>OR <strong>Allow students to adjust the time or just complete the activity after the time limit is reached. And, record the time spent with the results.</strong></li>
        </ul>
 
        <h3>Rationale</h3>
        <p>Some students with disabilities need additional time to complete activities. The school's specialists determine the amount of additional time students should receive on timed activities. This provides just enough additional time to account for performing the mechanics of the activity (e.g. reading, writing, operating a computer) with a disability. So, schools often assign accommodations such as "time and a half" or "double time".</p>
        <p>By following this guideline, we meet the schools' need for products that allow extended time.</p>

      <div class="guideline_content">
        <p class="summary">Ensure that current screen reading software (screen readers) can read the media in a sensible order.</p>
        <p>Note: In many cases, the reading order will be fine naturally. The techniques offered here explain how the reading order is established and how to make corrections if needed.</p>

        <h3>Rationale</h3>
        <p>Screen readers, browsers, and media players work together to try to provide a sensible reading order. However, sometimes the organization of the content results in a reading order that does not make sense. For example, commonly, features that are listed side-by-side might be read intermixed with each other, as in the table below:</p>
        <table class="pe-table--borders">
          <caption class="pe-sr-only">an unstructured table (antipattern) showing 2 rows, 4 cells of content and listing their reading order</caption>

            <td>
              <p>(read second)</p>
              <p>Today's Schedule</p>
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>
              <p>(read third)</p>
              <ul class="pe-list--unstyled">

            </td>

              <p>(read fourth)</p>
              <ul class="pe-list--unstyled">
                <li>8 AM Breakfast – Cafeteria</li>

                <li>6:30 Dinner – Ball Room 2</li>

        </table>
        <p>This type of issue can be resolved without changing the visual layout. For example, in HTML, we restructure the underlying source code. In Flash, we indicate a reading order by numbering elements behind the scenes.</p>

        <h3>HTML &amp; JavaScript</h3>
        <h4>Layout Tables (legacy)</h4>
        <p>The reading order for a layout table begins with the first cell in the first row. In left-to-right languages, like English, this is the left-most cell in the top row. The cell adjacent to that cell is next, and so on. Then the second row is read in the same way. The image below shows the reading order for a layout table in a left-to-right language:<br>
        <img width="276" height="181" alt="A table is read from left to right. First row: first and second cells. Second row: third, fourth and fifth cells. Third row: sixth cell." src="images/Table_order.png"></p>
        <p>This is actually the source code order. If your content does not make logical sense following that order:</p>
        <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
          <li><p>Update to a CSS layout where the source code order is logical</p>
 OR</li>
          <li>Reorganize the table layout so that the contents appear in a logical order in the source code. And, add <code>role="presentation"</code> to the opening <code>&lt;table&gt;</code> tag for layout tables to prevent screen readers from announcing the table structure.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>CSS Layouts</h4>
        <p>The reading order follows the source code order in html and xhtml, regardless of how the items are arranged on the page using CSS. So, be sure to place elements and content in a logical reading order in the source code. This will also make your page readable when CSS positioning is over-ridden, turned off, or not available.</p>
        <p>A common challenge occurs when Web developers wish to have a horizontal list of letters or numbers situated at the right side of the screen. Often they place these links in the source code backwards (for example, z through a), and then they use CSS <code>float:right</code> to float each item to the right. Since z is first, it floats all they way to the right and the rest of the letters follow, line up and look correct visually. <mark><a href="http://wps.pearsoned.com/wps/media/objects/7400/7577911/PG4CSS2.html">Open example of incorrect use of float: right in a new window</a>.</mark> However, the links are backwards for screen reader users and users who have turned off CSS. To resolve this, put the links in a-z order in a <code>div</code> element. Then, size the <code>div</code> so that it is only just large enough for the links. Finally, apply CSS <code>float:right</code> to the <code>div</code>. <mark><a href="http://wps.pearsoned.com/wps/media/objects/7400/7577911/PG4CSS2FIX.html">Open example of corrected use of float:right in a new window</a>.</mark></p>

        <h4>When JavaScript and/or CSS is used to Place Elements on the Page</h4>
        <p>As mentioned above, the reading order in HTML follows the source code order. So, if you use JavaScript to write source code, as you might do using <code>document.write</code> or by setting innerHTML, just add it in a location where it makes sense. Similarly, if elements are typed into the html source and then hidden or shown using JavaScript, as you might do using display:none and display:block, just place them in the source code according to the order in which the page should be read.</p>
        <p>However, if you use Document Object Model coding to add elements to the page, the reading order might not follow the source code order. When objects are created and stored in variables, the order in which the code is written is not relevant. Instead, the structure of the Document Object Model itself will determine the reading order. Within each object in the Document Object Model, starting with the document object, child nodes are read in order from the first node to the last node (<code>x.childNodes[0], x.childNodes[1] ... x.lastChild</code>). As each child object is encountered, its children are read in a similar fashion, so that the tree is read as shown in the following example, where a <code>div</code> object contains the following child objects:</p>
        <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--ordered">
          <li> some text ("a text node" in DOM terminology)</li>
          <li> a link</li>
          <li> an ordered list with three child list items</li>
          <li> an image with an alt attribute</li>
        </ul>
        <p><img width="400" height="230" alt="The items are read in the following order: the text node, the link, the ordered list items (first through third) and finally the image." src="images/DOM_order.png"><br>
        So, when dynamically adding nodes to the document object model (e.g. appendChild, insertBefore, replaceChild) place them in a logical location in the document tree. For example, if a newly added paragraph should be read just before an ordered list with id L, you might add it as follows:</p>
        <pre><code>
/* Create paragraph */ 
var newP = document.createElement("p");
/* Backslash below escapes line break */
var PText = document.createTextNode("This \
            list will help with the questions \
            you missed!");
newP.appendChild(PText);
/* Get existing ordered list  */
var existingL = document.getElementById("L");
/* Get parent of existing ordered list  */
var parentObj = existingL.parentNode 
/*Place new paragraph inside the parent of the ordered list, just before the ordered list  */
parentObj.insertBefore(newP, existingL);</code></pre>
        <p>And, in this example, a new paragraph is created and is placed just after an ordered list with id <code>L</code>:</p>
        <pre><code>
/* Create paragraph */
var newP = document.createElement("p");
var PText = document.createTextNode("Good job with the list; now take a break!");
newP.appendChild(PText);
/* Get existing ordered list  */
var existingL = document.getElementById("L");
/* Get parent of existing ordered list  */
var parentObj = existingL.parentNode
/* Get the next sibling of the existing ordered list */
var nextS = existingL.nextSibling
/* don't worry if there's a chance nextS will be null - see below */
/* Place new paragraph inside the parent of the ordered list,  just after the ordered list  */
parentObj.insertBefore(newP, nextS);
/* if nextS is null, insertBefore will place newP at the end of parentObj, which would be just after the existing ordered list, in that case. */</code></pre>
 
        <h3><mark>Flash &amp; Flex</mark></h3>
        <p><mark>Reading order in Flash and Flex is set according to an algorithm that chooses the next item to read based on which item is top-most and/or left-most. As such, if you have a purely vertical layout, the movie will be read from top to bottom. This is often a sensible reading order. Similarly, if you have a purely horizontal layout, the movie will be read from left to right, which again, is often a sensible reading order. However, when there are both vertical and horizontal elements, the reading order often becomes nonsensical and confusing.

If you test your movie or application in JAWS and the reading order makes sense, there is nothing else that you need to do to meet PG 4. 

If you test your movie or application in JAWS and the reading order does not make sense, you will need to set the tabIndex for each item in your movie that should be read with a screen reader. TabIndex in Flash/Flex works differently from the tabindex property in HTML. In Flash/Flex, when correcting the reading order, you must set the tabIndex for every element that a screen reader should read, including buttons, links, form fields, other active element, and any text elements.

You can set tabIndex in the accessibility panel in the Flash authoring tool.
You can also set tabIndex using action script: myObject.tabIndex = 10;
You can set tabIndex in MXML (Mark-up used in Flex Builder, Flex Server, or Flash Builder Applications): <code>&lt;mx:Text x="35" y="27" tabIndex="10" text="Welcome Students!" /&gt;</code>
You can skip numbers when setting tabIndex. So, counting by 10 is wise, as it allows you to insert items in the middle of the reading order without renumbering every item. For example, if you realize you need a new item between the items with tabIndex 20 and 30, you can use a tabIndex of 25.</mark></p>
        <h4><mark>Additional Details</mark></h4>
        <p><mark>In order to set the reading order using tabIndex, you will need to avoid using static text. In addition, there are special considerations regarding instance names, off-screen elements, and embedded movies. See <a href="http://www.adobe.com/accessibility/products/flash/reading.html">Adobe's Flash Reading Order Guide (new window)</a> for additional details.</mark></p>

        <h4><mark>Common Misconception</mark></h4>
        <p><mark>Many developers worry that setting tabIndex this way will force keyboard access users to tab to each bit text while trying to reach a button, link or form control. This is true in HTML, but this is not the case in Flash and Flex. TabIndex does not change whether or not an element is treated as an active element for keyboard access.</mark></p>

        <h3>Android Applications</h3>
        <p>The reading over is based on an algorithm which finds the nearest neighbor in a given direction. The reading order cannot be changed but focus order can be modified, see <a href="#pg6">PG 6</a> for more details.</p>

        <h3>iOS Applications</h3>
        <p>The reading order in iOS applications is defined by the order in which the elements are added to the screen. In the individual, table or custom container views, the order is set by the order in which they are defined in the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/accessibility/uiaccessibilitycontainer">UIAccessibilityContainer</a> protocol array.  To change the reading order use <code>accessibilityElementAtIndex</code>, <code>accessibilityElementCount</code> and <code>indexOfAccessibilityElement</code>.</p>

        <h3>PDF in Acrobat</h3>
        <img style="float:right" alt="" src="images/tags-tree.jpg">
        <p>The reading order in a PDF document is determined by the order of the tags in the tags tree.</p>
        <p>If the reading order of the PDF document is not sensible, simply drag the tags for the elements into the desired order in Acrobat's tags panel. This will not affect the visual layout.</p>
        <p>The location of the tags panel will vary depending on your version of Acrobat. In Acrobat 9 Pro, for example, you can find the panel at View &gt; Navigation Panels &gt; Tags.</p>
        
        <h3 style="clear:both;">Word</h3>
        <p>The reading order in a Word document is often fine and cannot be modified as it can in HTML or a PowerPoint presentation. In Word, content is read top-down, left-right. Tables are also read in this order which works well for typical data tables but can cause similar issues as HTML tables when used for layout.</p>
        <p>To avoid empty paragraphs, use paragraph spacing and column breaks for fine control of text placement. This will reduce how often screen readers such as JAWS says blank when navigating with reading keys.</p>

        <h3>Text Boxes and Floating Images</h3>
        <p>Avoid using text boxes and floating images. Screen readers often do not read the content of text boxes and do not announce their presence. When using images, use "inline" text wrapping to ensure that they are read with the text in the correct order. Images that float in front of the text have the same issues as text boxes.</p>

        <h3>PowerPoint</h3>
        <p>The reading order in PowerPoint is determined by the order shown in the selection pane, <strong>and that order is from the bottom to the top of the list of elements</strong>. Use the buttons in the selection pane to arrange the items properly. Consider making this adjustment for each master slide layout of the template to reduce future work.</p>
        <p>When adding any new elements to a slide, check the reading order to ensure that it presents the content in a way that makes sense. In PowerPoint 2007 and 2010, use the selection pane. The reading order is the order in which the shapes are listed starting with the bottom-most item to top.<br>
        <img width="450" height="282" alt="Go to Home menu and choose select in the editing menu.  In the drop down menu, choose Selection Pane.  Use the re-order buttons to move content in the list." src="images/PowerPoint-ReadingOrder.jpg"></p>
        <p>In PowerPoint 2003, the reading order is determined using the outline panel and the drawing order. The outline panel provides an outline of the text content that appears on the slides. For content that does not appear in the outline panel, tab through the elements of the slide to verify the order. To change the order, right click and element and choose Order. This command is also available on the Drawing toolbar. As with all versions of PowerPoint, save time by ensuring that the order of the master slide layouts is correct before adding slides.</p>

In that case, the reading order would alternate between the sign-in and the register sections. Also, lists of numbered or lettered links aligned to the right are often in a backwards reading order.

      <h2 id="g5">Guideline 5. Make sure screen reader users can find dynamic additions to the screen (Findable Added Content)</h2>
      <div class="guideline_content">
        <p class="summary">Ensure that screen reader users can find new dynamically-added content (e.g. expanding menus, alerts, error messages, hints that appear on rollover).</p>

        <h3>Rationale</h3>
        <p>When the content of page changes once the page has loaded, some accessibility concerns arise that are not addressed by accessibility guidelines for static content:</p>
        <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
          <li>How will a screen reader user who may already have read much of the page know that the new content is now available?</li>
          <li>How will a screen reader user know where to find the new content?</li>
          <li>Will common screen reader applications recognize changes to the page?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Since dynamic content changes and additions are most often designed and tested by users who can see a large portions of the screen at once, these features most often work well for such users. These features can also work well for screen reader users, but they must be designed and tested with this type of access in mind.</p>

        <h3>HTML &amp; JavaScript</h3>
        <h4>Error Messages that Appear without a Page Refresh | Custom Alert Windows that don't Contain Buttons or other User Interaction</h4>
        <p>The goal is to alert screen reader users to the new information. In addition, especially if the feedback appears while the user is typing into a field, the goal will be to provide the error message without moving the screen reader user's focus (i.e. without taking the text-insertion point out of the form field).</p>
        <p>The WAI-ARIA "alert" role makes this possible. Simply make <code>role="alert"</code> an attribute of <strong>both</strong>:
        <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
          <li>The outer-most container that is added to the page AND</li>
          <li>The parent element of that element. Create a container just for the purpose of receiving the alert. (Needed for Safari with VoiceOver as well as, the lower priority configuration, Window-Eyes with IE)</li>
        </ul>
        <p><mark>To support TalkBack with Chrome on Android devices add <code>aria-live="assertive"</code> to the container element that will receive the alert. Although not a top priority configuration, this is also needed to support NVDA with IE.</mark></p>
        <mark>** HI PRIO ** external link</mark>
        <p><mark><a href="http://www.manateeroad.com/alert.html">A test page for this technique</a></mark></p>
        <p>This will cause screen readers to speak the error or alert when it appears visually. But, it won't make any change to the screen reader user's location on the page. So, for example, if a user is typing a password when the message is read, the user can continue to type that password, uninterrupted.</p>
        <p>In screen magnifiers, sometimes the magnification level is so high that only a small section of the screen is shown at once. Magnifiers can be set to move focus to alerts and this will cause the error message or the upper left corner of the error message (in left-to-right languages) to be shown on the screen. Because of this, the upper left corner (or upper right in right-to-left languages) of the alert object should show the beginning of the error message.</p>
        <p>Note: <code>role="alert"</code> has no effect if it is just on the page when the page loads. The role only comes into play when the area is updated without a page refresh. As such, when an identical page, except for an added alert message, is loaded, different techniques are needed. See the section just below on this topic.</p>

        <h4>Error Messages that Appear with Page Refresh</h4>
        <p>In this scenario, screen reader users will hear that a new page has loaded. Because of this, the error message is not actually dynamically-added content! However, particularly if the page is the very same page shown again, it is good usability for screen readers users to make it easy to locate the error message. Some combination of the following techniques should be used:</p>
        <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
          <li>Most often, screen readers read the title of the page when the page loads. So, it is helpful to including all or part of the error message in the page title.</li>
          <li>The most common way that screen reader users explore a new page is that they read the headings on the page. Making all or part of the error message a heading is very helpful.</li>
          <li>Screen reader users often tab from form element to form element, hearing the form label for each form element. In cases where detailed form error messages are provided for each form field, including those errors as part of the form label can be a helpful technique. See Pearson Guideline 14 for techniques on how to code form labels so that they will be read when screen reader users tab to form elements.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you allow the page to load without the error message, and then add the error message using JavaScript after the page has fully loaded, you can use the <code>role="alert"</code> technique described in the section just above.</p>

        <h4>Standard JavaScript Alert, Confirm, and Prompt Messages</h4>
        <p>Common screen readers and screen magnifiers should be able to handle these without any special coding.</p>
        <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
          <li>Confirm: <code>var r=confirm("Continue?");</code></li>
          <li>Alert: <code>alert('Please login first');</code> OR</li>
          <li>Prompt: <code>var name=prompt("Please enter your name","");</code></li>
        </ul>
        <p>For information on using these and for examples, see: <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_popup.asp">w3schools.com's JavaScript Popup Windows (opens in new window)</a>.</p>

        <h4>Custom Dialogs that need to be Dismissed by the User | Custom Modal Windows</h4>
        <p>When the dialog appears, use JavaScript to move focus to the interactive element in the dialog that is most likely to be used first. When the dialog is closed, be sure to return focus to a logical location, such as the control that caused the dialog to appear.</p>
        <p>If the dialog serves an "alert" function, add the following two attributes to the outermost element that is added to the page when the message appears:</p>
        <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
          <li><code>role="alertdialog"</code> AND</li>
          <li><code>aria-describedby="id"</code> where <code>id</code> is the id of the message you want read automatically when the alert dialog first appears.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If the dialog isn't really an "alert" and is more of just a separate window, add the following two attributes to the outermost element that is added to the page when the message appears:</p>
        <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
          <li><code>role="dialog"</code> AND</li>
          <li><code>aria-label="my message"</code> where <code>my message</code> is the message you want read automatically when the dialog first appears OR <code>aria-labelledby="id"</code> where <code>id</code> is the id of the message you want read automatically when the alert dialog first appears. (Yes, aria-labelledby should have the repeated letter l.)</li> 
        </ul>
        <p>These attributes tell screen readers and screen magnifiers to announce these additions to the screen as alert dialogs or as dialogs. Some screen readers will also switch into "forms mode" for navigation of the dialog. In this mode, the dialog is announced and then screen reader users move between active elements, often skipping inactive content. So, be sure that all content in the dialog is included through <code>aria-describedby</code>, <code>aria-label</code>, or <code>aria-labelledby</code> and/or through form labels. Form labels are discussed in detail in <a href="#pg14">Pearson Guideline 14</a>.</p>
        <p>For older configurations that don't support <code>role="alertdialog"</code> or <code>role="dialog"</code>, try to give an overview of the purpose of the dialog with the control that gains focus. For example, you might use "stay on this page" as your button text, instead of something less descriptive, such as "stay".</p>

        <h4>Buttons that Reveal Content (e.g. expanding menus, expanding help topics)</h4>
        <p>One of the simplest techniques is to place the new content in the reading order just after the control that initiated the change.</p>
        <p>It is important that users will know whether the section is expanded or collapsed. See <a href="#pg20">Pearson Guideline 20</a> for information on this.</p>

        <h4>When Important Information Appears on Mouse Over</h4>
        <p>Often information is coded to appear <code>onmouseover</code> and <code>onfocus</code>. For example, when a mouse is pointed at a book cover image, a <code>div</code> element might appear as a box that provides more information about the book.</p>
        <p>This information is at risk of being inaccessible to screen reader users. It only appears in the reading order for a short time, often while the screen reader is reading other content. You will have to decide if the information should always be read by the screen reader. If the information is essential or particularly brief, it is likely it should always be read, so you might:</p>
        <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
          <li>Include the information as alt-text for a related image, OR</li>
          <li><p>Keep the information visible to screen readers even when it is hidden for visual users by placing the information off-screen:</p>
          <pre><code>.screen_readers_only {
  position:absolute;
  left:-999px;
  top:auto;
  width:1px;
  height:1px;
  overflow:hidden; }</code></pre></li>
        </ul>
        <p>If the information is rather long and not necessary for a basic understanding of the page, it might be best if it is not part of the general reading order. To allow the content to be read on-demand only:</p>
        <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
          <li><p>Include the information in the <code>longdesc</code> attribute of a related image:</p>
          <pre><code>&lt;img src="weather_today.gif"
  alt="Sunny 73 degrees"
  longdesc="weather_detail.html&gt;"</code></pre> OR</li>
          <li><p>Place the information on a second page and provide a link placed off screen so that the link is only available to screen reader users:</p>
          <pre><code>a.screen_readers_only {
  position:absolute;
  left:-999px;
  top:auto;
  width:1px;
  height:1px;
  overflow:hidden; }</code></pre></li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Areas that Update Periodically (e.g. News Feed, Social Features)</h4>
        <p>First, place the new content in a predictable consistent location within the page structure. The containing structure for this content should have a heading that tells the user what the section is for. Consider including the following information:</p>
        <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
          <li>That the area is dynamic</li>
          <li>Which conditions that will cause an update</li>
          <li>Which content is currently present (or newest)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For example:</p>
        <pre><code>&lt;h2&gt;Hourly News as of 1 PM Today&lt;/h2&gt;</code></pre>
        <p>In this case, a screen reader user will know that the section may be updated and can use heading reading techniques to scan the headings on the page and discover whether an update has been made.</p>
        <p>If all or part of the heading is not needed for sighted users, you can hide the heading as follows:</p>
          <pre><code>h2.hidden {
  position:absolute;
  left:-999px;
  top:auto;
  width:1px;
  height:1px;
  overflow:hidden; }</code></pre>
        <p>Second, particularly for social features, there should be a way for students or instructors to be notified that new information is available. The following techniques are some options. You may wish to allow your users to select an option in user preferences.</p>
        <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
          <li>Make any text that announces the new content into an alert by placing role="alert" on the outermost HTML element that is added to the page when the icon or the alert appears. For example: <code>&lt;div role="alert"&gt;You have a new message&lt;/div&gt;</code></li>
          <li>Play a beep or a tone when a new message appears. (Thanks to Michael Brooks of Penn State University for suggesting this technique and for pointing out that this has worked well for some students.)</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Progress Bars and Loading Messages</h4>
        <p>If you know the percent progress, <mark>** HI PRIO ** <a href="http://www.manateeroad.com/progressbar.html">use a progress bar as is shown here</a>.</mark> Of course, the visual can be whatever you like. While the WAI-ARIA specification implies that a variety of types of values may one day work, this only works in current screen readers/browser with percent values.</p>
        <p>If you don’t know the percent progress, and the load times are very short, one possibility is to use an alert that says "Page is loading" and then move focus to the new content when it is ready.</p>
        <p>If you don’t know the percent progress and if the load times are longer, chose what you think is a max load time for the activity, then create a time-base version of this where the progress bar reaches 100% at that max time. This way, most of the time, the progress will be better than what the bar reports, which is fine. Have the progress bar code loop (start over at 0%, once it reaches 100%), just in case there is a very long load time.</p>

        <h3>Android Applications</h3>
        <p><mark>The goal is to help Talkback (the Android screen reader) users know about the important information. When the application interface elements change dynamically, the <code>contentDescription</code> and <code>hint</code> property should be updated to reflect the current state of the interface element. If the dynamically-added content should be read by the screen reader, move focus to that component on the page so it will be read by Talkback.</mark> (still valid?)</p>

        <h3>iOS Applications</h3>
        <p><mark>When the application interface elements change dynamically, the <code>accessibilityLabel</code> and <code>accessibilityHint</code> should be updated to reflect the current state of the interface element.</mark> (still valid?)</p>
        <p>If the layout of the application screens change or if there is an event that happens on the screen, use the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/accessibility/uiaccessibility">UIAccessibilityNotifications in the UIAccessibility protocol</a> to send status notifications to VoiceOver to help users navigate the new layout.</p>

        <h3>PowerPoint</h3>
        <p>PowerPoint presentations can have dynamic content in the form of slide animations. Be sure to test animations with a screen reader because a content is not always read consistently. It is best to use animations triggered by mouse clicks so that it can be controlled by the user during a slideshow. Animations triggered by mouse clicks can be controlled using both a mouse and keyboard.</p>

        <img width="91" height="65" alt="box drawn with thin blue dashes surrounds blue link text" src="images/html_links_ff3.png">
        <h4>HTML links in Safari 3:</h4>
        <img width="91" height="65" alt="box drawn with thick fuzzy blue lines and rounded corners surrounds the link text" src="images/html_links_s3.png">
        <p>Some form elements have special focus indicators. For example, a text field that is in focus will contain the text cursor as shown in IE 6 below:</p>
        <img width="400" height="61" alt="A short, but wide white rectangle represents the text input field. In the field, far to the left, is a vertical black line, a visual representation of the input cursor. " src="images/text_cursor_ie6.png">
        <p>However, it is possible to obscure the focus indicator through visual effects or through the layout of the content.</p>
        
        <h3>General Techniques</h3>
        <p>If the focus indicator is not visible, we have two choices in most media types:</p>
        <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--ordered">
          <li>Correct the reason the default focus indicator is not visible</li>
          <li>Add a new focus indicator. Decorative mouse-over effects can often be reused for this.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>HTML &amp; JavaScript</h3>
        <ol class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--ordered">
          <li>Test to be sure the focus indicator is visible in each supported browser.</li>
          <li>If the focus indicator is partially hidden due to the layout, adjust your CSS to accommodate the focus indicator. For example, if you increase the padding the focus indicator may be hidden by neighboring elements:</li>
              <p><img width="118" height="92" alt="Only the upper right corner and the left side of the focus rectangle are visible. The rest is hidden by the padding of neighboring links." src="images/neighboring_elements.png"><br>
              This is because the focus indicator surrounds the padding in block elements. So, in this case, you might use the margin property in place of padding. The focus indicator does not surround margins.</p>
          <li>If the visual design makes the focus indicator difficult to see on your supported browsers, create your own visual effect for the on-focus state. The link in the image below is a grey box that has focus in Firefox 2. The focus indicator is nearly invisible, a good candidate for a custom visual effect:</li>
              <p><img width="162" height="205" alt="The focus indicator in Firefox 2 is a black dashed line, so it blends into the dark grey box it surrounds and can barely be seen." src="images/custom_visual_effect.png"><br>
              If you've ever created a mouse-over effect, creating an on-focus effect will seem familiar:</p>
              <p>OR</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Use the CSS :focus class as you would use the CSS :hover class:</li>
                  <pre><code>/* mouse */ a:hover {background-color: #FFFFCC;}  /* keyboard */ a:focus {background-color: #FFFFCC;}</code></pre>
                  <p>Since a:focus doesn’t work in IE (as of IE 7) you may want to add  a:active in addition to a:focus:</p>
                  <pre><code>/* keyboard */ a:focus {background-color: #FFFFCC;} a:active {background-color: #FFFFCC;}</code></pre>
                <li>Use the JavaScript event handler onFocus as you would use the event handler onMouseOver. Also use onBlur as you would use onMouseOut. </li>
                  <pre><code>&lt;a href="filename.html"        onmouseover="JavaScriptCodeOn();"       onfocus="JavaScriptCodeOn();"        onmouseout="JavaScriptCodeOff();"      onblur="JavaScriptCodeOff();" &gt;</a></code></pre>
                  <p>OR</p>
                  <pre><code>&lt;a href="filename.html"             onmouseover="JavaScriptCodeOn();"       onfocus="this.onmouseover"        onmouseout="JavaScriptCodeOff();"       onblur="this.onmouseout" &gt;</a></code></pre>
              </ul>
          <li>The "outline" for <code>onfocus</code> is in fact the default focus indicator. So, do not remove the "outline" for the onfocus state using CSS styling.</li> 
        </ol>
        <h3>Android Applications</h3>
          <p>When a user uses either swipe gestures or a Bluetooth keyboard, a visible indicator on the screen should show the current element that has focus. This is done by default for standard elements. Custom elements should set the style when <code> state_focused="true".</code></p>
          <p>Android provides several elegant ways to change the visual appearance based on state:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Change color: <a href="https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/resources/color-list-resource.html">Open Google's Color State List Resource in a new window.</a></li>
              <li>Change images: <a href="https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/resources/drawable-resource.html#StateList">Open Google's  Drawable State List Resource in a new window.</a></li>
            </ul>
        <h3>iOS Applications</h3>
          <p>iOS provides a visible focus indicator for elements that receive keyboard input.</p>
          <p>When a user uses swipe gestures with VoiceOver, the element on the page that has VoiceOver focus will have a black rectangle outline. This focus indicator is determined from the property which is a subclass of <code>UIView</code>. Objects should not override the visual focus indicator or set the <code>accessibilityFrame</code> property to <code>nil.</code></p>
        <h3>PDF in Acrobat</h3>
          <p>In the link properties, specify the link appearance.</p>
          <img width="339" height="267" src="images/link_appearance.jpg">
          <p>It is important to have the following settings:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Link Type</strong> – Visual Rectangle</li>
            <li><strong>Highlight Style</strong> – Inset</li>
            <li><strong>Line Thickness</strong> – Thin</li>
            <li><strong>Line Style</strong> – Underlined</li>
            <li><strong>Color</strong> – Set a color that has 4.5:1 color ratio between the text color and text background color. See PG26 for more details on color contrast.</li>

      <h2 id="g8">Guideline 8. Provide keyboard access instructions (Keyboard Access Instructions)</h2>     
      <div class="guideline_content">
        <p class="summary">Provide instructions describing the keys (or gestures) needed for keyboard access if your media uses keys or techniques that differ from user agent (e.g. Web browser, PDF reader, Flash player) or mobile device defaults.</p>
        <h3>Rationale</h3>
          <p>Keyboard access users will usually be aware of basic keyboard access methods in their user agents. So, they will try those when they arrive at your media. </p>
          <p>However, users (and even accessibility specialists at schools) cannot discover non-typical keyboard access methods without viewing the source code. Often the source code is not available (as in Flash applications). Even when it is available, review of the source code is too much to expect.</p>
        <h3>Commonly Used Keys</h3>
          <p>These are the basic keyboard interactions that typically work for Web products. If your application uses only these, there is no need to provide special keyboard access instructions:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Tab and Shift Tab to bring elements into focus</li>
            <li>Enter or Spacebar to activate elements</li>

      <h2 id="g9">Guideline 9. Support navigation within the page (In-page Navigation)</h2>
      <div class="guideline_content">
          <p class="summary">When distinguishable features or sections (e.g. navigation, main content, individual news articles) appear on a page or in a document, provide a way to navigate to the features or sections using a screen reader and the keyboard.</p> 
          <h3>Rationale</h3>
            <p>Mouse users commonly navigate Web pages by skimming the page visually. When they see a feature of interest, they can immediately read the text there and use a mouse to access interactive elements there.</p>          
            <p>So, designers might not think about in-page navigation unless a page contains a very long list that is not pleasant to skim visually, such as a glossary. </p>        
            <p>However, keyboard access users (with and without screen readers) move through a page, item by item, starting at the top. So, for example, if 40 links appear before the link the user wants, the user may have to press tab 40 times to reach the desired link.</p>          
            <p>Similarly, if there are many articles on the page, screen reader users may have to listen to a lot of content before finding the article of interest.</p>         
            <p>In-page navigation addresses these issues.</p>          
            <p>Additional Benefits: In-page navigation is useful for users without disabilities as well. If a student needs to check a fact on a long page of text, jumping from heading to heading is much faster and more pleasant than watching for the heading needed while scrolling the page.</p>
          
          <h3>HTML &amp; JavaScript</h3>
          <h4>Headings (h1 through h6)</h4>
          <p>Organize pages using HTML headings (e.g. <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;h3&gt;</code>). This allows screen reader users to jump from heading to heading to read and interact with the content under each heading only as needed.</p>         
          <p>If desired, you can use CSS to change or remove all formatting associated with these heading elements:</p>         
          <pre><code>h2.nostyle_inline {      /* 1em results in the same font size that         would be used for plain text in that         location on the page */      font-size: 1em;      /* standard font weight */      font-weight: normal;      /* no extra space */      padding: 0;     margin: 0;      /* With display set to inline,        headings can appear inline with other        text. For example, bold text at the         beginning of a paragraph might         serve as a heading. */      display: inline; } </code></pre>
          <p>If necessary for visual effects, you can also use an image within a heading tag. (See <a href="#g21">PG 21</a> regarding images of text.)</p>
          
          <pre><code>&lt;h1&gt;    &lt;img src="sea_mammals.gif"        alt="Mammals of the Sea"&gt; &lt;/h1&gt;</code></pre>
          <p>But, don't use heading tags like <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> for the headers inside tables. See <a href="#g11">Pearson Guideline 11</a> for the correct semantic markup for tables.</p>
          
          <h4>WAI-ARIA Headings (not recommended)</h4>
          <p>It is now possible to mark HTML elements as headings without using the traditional HTML heading tags. This even works in many screen reader/browser combinations. However, the traditional HTML heading tags are still supported in many more places. So, if you can use the traditional tags, that is the best option for universal accessibility.</p>
          
          <p>These headings are defined through two attributes:</p>
          <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
            <li><code>role="heading"</code></li>
            <li><code>aria-level</code></li>
          </ul>
          <p>For example, to create the equivalent of an <code>h2</code> element, you could type: <code>&lt;div role="heading" aria-level="2"&gt;</code>.</p>
          <h4>Using Headings in HTML 5</h4>
          <p>In the current world of mash-ups and content reuse, often some content will be used in more than one place. What if your content is used in two places, where the surrounding heading structure is different? HTML 5 offers an answer.</p>
          
          <p>The current recommendation is to <a href="http://adrianroselli.com/2016/08/there-is-no-document-outline-algorithm.html">continue to use h1 through h6 as needed</a>.</p>
          
          <h4>HTML 5 Sectioning Root Elements - Elements that Restart the Heading Structure (blockquote, body, details, dialog, fieldset, figure, td)</h4>
          <p>Headings within a Sectioning Root Element are immune to the effects of any Sectioning Content Elements that contain the Sectioning Root Element. So, if you have a <code>dialog</code> element inside a <code>section</code> element, the headings within the <code>dialog</code> element will stay just as you type them, regardless of any surrounding code. This is special, as headings inside all other HTML elements will adjust if the element is inside a Sectioning Content Element. </p>
          
          <p>The other special quality of Sectioning Root Elements is that they can have their own heading structure within a page. For example, a <code>dialog</code> might begin with an <code>h1</code> heading even if it appears on the page after an <code>h3</code>.</p>
          
          <p>The only time that a heading within a Sectioning Root Element will act as a virtual heading is if that heading is inside a Sectioning Content Element, inside a Sectioning Root Element. To understand this, note that the <code>body</code> element is a Sectioning Root Element and that the others basically let you start your heading structure over, as though you had a Web page within the page.</p>
          
          <p>Here is the current list of HTML 5 elements that restart the heading structure:</p>
          <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
            <li>blockquote</li>
            <li>body</li>
            <li>details</li>
            <li>dialog</li>
            <li>fieldset</li>
            <li>figure</li>
            <li>td</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>WAI-ARIA Landmarks</h4>
          <p>Often navigation menus, banners, and footers are not preceded by a visible heading because it is visually clear what they are. WAI-ARIA landmark roles can be used to identify these areas and allow screen readers users to navigation to them.</p>
          <img width="350" height="252" alt="In an example page layout, banner stretches across the page, followed by navigation, which contains search. Under that, main is on the left and complementary on the right. ContentInfo marks a page footer." src="images/simple_landmarks.png">
          
          <p>Landmark roles are simple to add to a page. Below are the definitions of each role quoted from <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/aria-practices/">WAI-ARIA 1.0 Authoring Practices, Editors' Draft 28 June 2011</a>.</p>
          <div class="side-bar-box">
            <code>banner</code>
            <p>"A region that contains the prime heading or internal title of a page."</p>
            <code>complementary</code>
            <p>"Any section of the document that supports but is separable from the main content, but is meaningful on its own even when separated from it."</p>
            <code>contentinfo</code>
            <p>"Meta information which applies to the first immediate ancestor whose role is not presentation."</p>
            <code>form</code>
            <p> "A region of the document that represents a collection of form-associated elements, some of which can represent editable values that can be submitted to a server for processing."</p>
            <code>main</code>
            <p>"Main content in a document."</p>
            <code>navigation</code>
            <p>"A collection of links suitable for use when navigating the document or related documents."</p>
            <code>search</code>
            <p>"The search tool of a Web document."</p>
          </div>
          <p>Each of the roles below should be used at most once per document:</p>
          <ul  class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
            <li><code>banner</code></li>
            <li><code>main</code></li>
            <li><code>contentinfo</code></li>
          </ul>
          <p>In most cases, that means they can each be used only once per HTML page. However, in some cases, a single HTML page may contain multiple items with role="document," and this would allow more per HTML page. We recommend that objects with these 3 roles be disjoint. In other words, they should not contain each other.</p>
          
          <p>Add the role attribute to an object that <strong>contains</strong> the corresponding section of the document: </p>
          
          <pre><code>&lt;div role="main"&gt; ... Main Content Here ... &lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>
          <img src="images/labeled_landmarks.jpg" width="350" height="252" alt="In this example, there are two areas marked with role='navigation'. One has aria-label='Site' and the other has aria-label='Chapter'">

          <p>If you use more than one of the same role, such as two navigation landmarks, provide labels distinguishing the two using an <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/complete#aria-label"><code>aria-label</code></a> attribute or an <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/complete#aria-labelledby"><code>aria-labelledby</code></a> attribute. While these labeling techniques are not yet widely supported, they work in JAWS 12 in our testing and will likely work in more screen readers soon. </p>
          
          <h4>Some implementation suggestions and tips</h4>
          <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
            <li>There are still screen readers in use today that do not support these roles, so be sure to still include at least a heading or a skip link to take the user to the main content.</li>
            <li>If you use some landmarks, we recommend that you cover every major section of the page using one role or another.</li>
            <li>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/complete#region"><code>region</code></a> landmark can be used if an area of your page needs a landmark and cannot use any of the roles defined above. Be sure to give it a label with <code>aria-label</code> or <code>aria-labelledby</code>.</li>
            <li>There shouldn't be too many landmarks on a page. Just the main 2-6 page sections should be landmarks.</li>
            <li>The application role changes screen reader navigation behavior dramatically and should not be used simply to provide a landmark.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>HTML 5 Elements that Sometimes Act as Landmarks (nav, footer, aside, section, header, article, form)</h4>
          <p>While WAI-ARIA landmarks are the most reliable way to create landmarks, it is important to note that some HTML 5 elements are announced as landmarks in some screen readers. The HTML 5 specification does not make it clear which elements should act as landmarks. Supplemental documentation does discuss this, but the current screen reader implementations do not match this documentation. </p>
          
          <p>It is pretty clear that the intention is that <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code> will act as a landmark.</p>
          
          <p>To move forward in this environment we suggest the following:</p>
          <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
            <li>Include WAI-ARIA landmark markup for the following HTML 5 section elements when you want them to be used as landmarks:Most likely, you will not want <code>&lt;form&gt;</code> to act as a landmark.</li>
            <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered"> 
              <li>&lt;footer role=”contentinfo”&gt;</li>
              <li>&lt;header role=”banner”&gt;</li>
              <li>&lt;nav role=”navigation”&gt;</li>
              <li>&lt;aside role=”complementary”&gt;</li>
              <li>&lt;section role=”region”&gt;, or a more specific role if appropriate.</li>
            </ul>
          <li>Finally, note that in some cases elements with <code>role="article"</code> and <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> elements are being treated as landmarks.</li>
            </ul>

          <h4>Frames</h4>
          <p>Traditional HTML Framesets provide one level of in-page navigation since keyboard users can jump between frames (usually using F6 and Shift F6) on a Web page. This does not apply to inline frames (<code>iframe</code>). If your site uses framesets and the main content frame has headings, your site probably meets <a href="#g9">Pearson Guideline 9</a>.</p>
          
          <h4>Skip Links</h4>
          <p>This is an older technique that would be deprecated if only browsers supported heading and landmark navigation without a screenreader or browser extension. </p>
          
          <p>If your site has many pages with the same structure, you might supplement heading navigation by providing a small number of anchor links at the top of the page that allow users to jump to the main areas of the page. Just as consistent page design would allow sighted users to focus immediately on the main content area as they move from page to page, a link might bring screen reader users to the "main content" on every page. This is particularly helpful in sites without frames where the headings in the main content area vary from page to page. </p>
          <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
          <li><strong>Do not create mini-menus of these links;</strong> no more than two, maybe three, should be in any particular location</li>
          <li>These links should refer to standard page elements such as 'main content' or 'navigation'.</li>
          <li>Make sure these links are either visible at all times or appear when a user tabs to the links:<br>
              <pre><code>.skiplink {                position: absolute;                clip: rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);  /* for Internet Explorer */                clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);                padding: 0;                border: 0;                height: 1px;                width: 1px;                overflow: hidden;            }              /* :active is needed for Internet Explorer */            .skiplink:focus, .skiplink:active {                padding:3px;                position: static;                width:auto;                height:auto;                clip:auto;                overflow:initial;             }</code></pre></li>
          <p>Otherwise keyboard access users who don't use a screen reader won't be able to use the links. They would also have to tab past invisible links, which can be confusing and time-consuming.</p>
          
          <li>There are bugs in Internet Explorer 5-11 that sometimes make these in-page links fail. Test the skip links by activating each link; then tab again. If the second tab goes to the top of the page or back to your skip link, your skip link is not working. To be sure to avoid this, add tabindex="-1" to the target of the link as shown in the code example below. </li>
              <pre><code>&lt;a name="skiptarget"        id="skiptarget"        tabindex="-1">          or content here     &lt;/a&bt;</code></pre>
          </ul>
          <a href="http://www.manateeroad.com/skiplink.html" target="_blank">Open sample skip link in new tab.</a>
          <h4>Tips</h4>
          <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
            <li>If JavaScript is used to change the page structure, be sure to update in-page navigation to reflect the change. For example, if the user can choose to remove the navigation bar and a link allows the user to jump to the navigation bar, the link should also be removed with the navigation bar.</li>
            <li>Do not use the <code>accesskey</code> attribute to meet this guideline. <code>Accesskey</code> can actually block keyboard access. (<a href="#g6">Pearson Guideline 6</a> explains why.)</li>
          </ul>
         
          <h3>Android Applications</h3>
          
          <p>Android applications are limited on what they can provide for in-page navigation. </p>
          
          <h4>Screen Title</h4>
          <p>The screen title should reflect the screen contents. The title can be set using the <code>setTitle</code> method.</p>
          
          <h4>Headings</h4>
          <p>Headings are not available in Android applications. Explicit headers can be provided in list views using <code>HeaderViewListAdapter.</code></p>
          
          <h3>iOS Applications</h3>
          
          <p>There are several ways to support in-page navigation in iOS applications:</p>
          <ol class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--ordered">
            <li>Navigation bar</li>
            <li>Tab Bar Controller</li>
            <li>Headings</li>
          </ol>
          
          <h4>Navigation Bar</h4>
          <p>The navigation bar provides easy navigation through an information hierarchy and the management of screen contents. To learn more about defining a navigation bar coding practices, see <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/WindowsViews/Conceptual/ViewControllerCatalog/Chapters/NavigationControllers.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40011313-CH2">Navigation Controllers</a>, <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uinavigationcontroller#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40006934">UINavigationController Class Reference</a>, and <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uinavigationbar#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40006887">UINavigationBar Class Reference</a>.</p>
          
          <p>When the user moves to a new screen, the following should change:</p>
          <ul  class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
            <li>The navigation bar title should change to current screen title which is set using UINavigationItem.</li>
            <li>The label for the back-button must be the previous level’s title.</li>
          </ul>
          
          <h4>Tab Bar Controller</h4>
          <p>The tab bar controller provides a way for a user to go to different views and allows users to easily move from one section to the next. For more information, see Tab Bar Controllers.</p>
          
          <h4>Headings</h4>
          <p>VoiceOver users will use headings to navigate between elements on the screen. Headings can be defined in iOS6 and later through <code>UIAccessibilityTraitHeader</code>, <code>UITableView</code>, <code>UINavigationBar</code> or content displayed through web view.</p>
          
          <h3>PDF in Acrobat</h3>
          
          <h4>Headings</h4>
          <p>Organize the document and set a logical heading structure by using the heading tag for the document title and h1-h6 tags for the section headers. This allows screen reader users to jump from heading to heading to read and interact with the content that interests them.</p>
          <h4>Bookmarks</h4>
          <p>Bookmarks are a set of links which allows a user to see the different sections of the document and easily navigate to them. Every major section in the document should be included as a bookmark.</p>
          <img src="images/bookmarks.jpg" width="187" height="150" alt="" align="right">
          <p>To generate bookmarks, go to the Bookmarks Panel. The process to add bookmarks differs slightly depending on the version of Acrobat and the operating system. To add bookmarks in Acrobat 9 Pro:</p>
          <ol class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--ordered">
              <li>Go the Bookmarks Panel at View > Navigation Panels > Bookmarks.</li>
              <li>Select "New bookmarks from structure" from the navigation panel options.</li>
              <li>Select the structure elements to include in the list of bookmarks. The bookmark names come from the title of the tags. If there is no title, the tag content is used.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>If there are bookmarks that should not be included, delete the bookmark in the tree structure. Add missing bookmarks manually by using the New Bookmark option in the navigation panel options.</p>
           
          <h3>Word</h3>
          <h4>Headings</h4>
          <p>Use Word heading styles to organize your document structure. A well-structured document that uses the built-in heading styles allows screen reader users to quickly and easily navigate the content. They can jump from heading to heading to access the information that interests them. </p>
          <p>Beware of formatting in Word documents that makes the content look like a heading visually but does not use heading styles. Such text is interpreted as plain text by the screen reader. These documents have no structure for screen readers.</p>
          <img src="images/word_headings.jpg" width="486" height="249" alt="In a Word document,  'Heading 3 + Trebuchet, 11 pt' is selected from the Format Menu to style a selected heading">
          
          <h4>Reference Links</h4>
          <p>Headings are the most widely used in-document navigation method, but tables of content and sometimes indexes are also used.</p>
          <p>When content contains other references such as bookmarks, bibliography entries and table of contents, and footnotes, add them by using the built-in Word features found on the reference menu. Do not create them manually.</p>
           
          <h3>PowerPoint</h3>
          
          <p>Screen reader users can navigate in slideshow mode easily with keyboard shortcuts. PowerPoint and JAWS shortcuts are available to read the page, read element by element, or advance the next animation event. See <a href="#g6">PG 6</a> for a partial list of shortcuts.</p>
          
          <p>However, certain actions are not as intuitive. For example, when a page contains a video or audio clip a user should tab to access the media control. It is possible to add alternate text to the object, but JAWS does not read that text when they tab to put a focus on the media controls. When the focus is on the media object, the user can either select shift-F10 to access the context menu, then Preview or they can press alt-P to play. Test slides with non-standard content layout or interactive objects using a screen reader to ensure that all content is accessible by keyboard.</p>
   
          <h3>Testing HTML</h3>
          <p>There are three recommended ways to provide in-page navigation in HTML: ARIA landmarks, headings and In-page links ("skip links"). Using the techniques below, see if enough support has been provided so that users can move to any of the primary page areas.</p>

          <p>A method shall be provided that permits users to skip repetitive navigation links. </p>
          <h4>3-O: Information and Relationships</h4>
          <p>Information and relationships conveyed through a presentation of electronic documents must be either PROGRAMMATICALLY DETERMINABLE or available in TEXT, and notification of changes to these must be available to user agents, including assistive technologies. For example:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Row and column headers are identified for data tables.<br/>
              Note: In order to achieve this provision, table objects in data operated on by the software would need to be associated with sufficient information to identify any row and column headers for the table, that the software can obtain as readily as it can obtain the table itself.
            </li>
            <li>In data tables that have two or more logical levels of row or column headers, data cells are associated with header cells.<br/>
              Note: In order to achieve this provision, cells in table objects with multiple logical levels of headers in data operated on by the software would need to be associated with sufficient information to identify any row and column headers for the table cell, that the software can obtain as readily as it can obtain the table cell itself.
            </li>
            <li>Section headings are identified.</li>
            <li>Form element LABELS are associated with form fields.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>...</p>
          <p>Provisions from the current Section 508 which have been consolidated, or dropped are:</p>  
          <p>... (o) Skip repetitive links</p>
          <p>When 3-O: Information and Relationships is met, user agents can provide better means for efficient keyboard navigation. In WCAG 2.0, meeting the provision that is comparable to 3-O is sufficient to meet the WCAG 2.0 provision on bypassing repetitive blocks of content.</p>

              <h3>Rationale</h3>
              <p>Media content will be transformed into:</p>
              <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
                <li>Spoken words</li>
                <li>Braille</li>
                <li>Large text</li>
                <li>Custom color schemes</li>
                <li>Custom layouts</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Text formatting can be lost in the transformation.</p>
              
              <p>Even when the information about text formatting is not entirely lost, it can become less noticeable or time-consuming to access. For example, when screen readers recognize a particular type of text-formatting, they handle it in one of two ways:</p>
              <ol class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--ordered">
                <li>Provide the information only if the screen reader user requests information on the formatting of the particular word</li>
                <li>Read it differently (e.g. louder, slower, different pitch) than surrounding text</li>
              </ol>
                <p>The former (1) makes finding particular words that have special formatting very time-consuming.</p>
              
              <p>The latter (2) is rare in screen readers today, even for semantic formatting such as HTML's <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;em&gt;</code> tags. </p>
              
              <p>Features that convey which text is emphasized are the responsibility of the assistive technology (e.g. screen reader, custom style sheet). Content developers cannot effectively add text that indicates which text is emphasized. This would make the experience worse for all users, including screen reader users. When formatting provides emphasis, content developers should simply use formatting that allows assistive technologies to provide the information as appropriate for their users (see <a href="#g11">PG 11</a>).</p>
              
              <p>However, if we extend the purpose of text formatting, using it to provide more information than simple emphasis, it is our responsibility to also provide the information through another method. For example, a paragraph of text might be followed by the instructions, "Explain the significance of the three bold words in the paragraph." In this case, we need to list the three words and, if the paragraph is very long, provide links back to the words in paragraph. This way, students who are using screen readers or custom formatting will be able to find the three words.</p>

              <h3>Techniques</h3>
              
              <h4>Discussing/Identifying Particular Words and Phrases</h4>
              <p>If text formatting is used to identify particular words or phrases (beyond just emphasizing the words or phrases) provide another way to find the words or phrases, such as:</p>
              <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
                <li>Quoting the text or the word. For example, "Select the best definition for the word 'like' as it is used in the paragraph."</li>
                <li>Providing a link to the text or the word.</li>
              </ul>
              <h4>Providing Data</h4>
              <p>If text formatting is used to provide data, also provide the data in another way, such as:</p>
              <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
                <li>Including the information as text. For example, if required lessons are in bold and optional lessons are in regular text, you could mark each required lesson with the word "required", or you could make each optional lesson with the word "optional". Another option is to mark one type of lesson with an * and then define the meaning of the * somewhere obvious on the page.</li>
                <li>Using reading order to make it easy to see relationships. For example, if the size of the name of a town is used to show the relative size of the area's population, include the population as text and also make sure the reading order (See <a href="#g4">Guideline 4</a>) is lowest to highest or highest to lowest. This way, just as a sighted user might skim the names and read largest to smallest based on text size, a blind screen reader user can do the same rather than having to read each town name and remember the numbers.</li>
              </ul>
              <h4>Marking up Text</h4>
              <p>If text formatting is used to illustrate the state of particular text, also provide this information in another way, such as:</p>
              <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
                <li>Use hidden text for screen reader users, so that some short phrase appears before and after the text. For example, if text has been highlighted by the instructor, hidden text can be added: "begin instructor highlight" and "end instructor highlight". See code clips for how to do this with CSS.</li>
                <li>Provide an additional view of the information. For example, if various differences in text are used to show three different revisions of a paragraph, many users will benefit from the ability to also read each version side-by-side in a table, divided into rows so as to highlight the changes.</li>
              </ul>
