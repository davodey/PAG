        <p>Even when two media types can each produce accessible results, choosing the most accessible technology will facilitate the process of making your product accessible.</p>

        <h3>HTML's Potential</h3>
        <p>HTML and XHTML have the highest potential for accessibility of any document type available today.</p>
        <p>HTML and XHTML provide access on multiple platforms and multiple browsers and work well with a wide variety of assistive technologies. (In this context, assistive technology is software and hardware that is used by people with disabilities to facilitate access to media.)</p>
        <p>HTML accessibility has been studied and refined for over 14 years and users of assistive technologies are typically comfortable working with HTML and XHTML.</p>
        <p>When coded with accessibility in mind, this media type gives users with disabilities:</p>
        <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
          <li>A choice of device, operating system and browser</li>
          <li>Access to all information presented</li>
          <li>The ability to use all controls</li>
          <li>The ability to skim the page for information without reading through the entire page</li>
          <li>Access to detailed text alternatives for complex images and also the ability to choose when and if to read those detailed text alternatives</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Added Benefits: HTML and XHTML are highly accessible because they are highly transformable and in widespread use. These qualities also make your content easy to reuse, to update and to transform for use with new technologies.
 
        <h3>JavaScripts's Potential</h3>
        <p>Including JavaScript in your HTML and XHTML media does not decrease the potential for accessibility. However, significant use of JavaScript introduces additional concerns that need to be addressed, primarily:</p>
        <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
          <li>Notifying users who do not see the screen or who do not see the entire screen of changes to the screen</li>
          <li>Making sure scripts work well when people use only a keyboard (no mouse) to navigate</li>
          <li>Designing custom user interfaces components so that they work for users who experience the page after it has been transformed for their needs (e.g. transformed into an auditory form for people with visual impairment)</li>
          <li>Rejecting inaccessible JavaScript libraries</li>
          <li>Ensuring that changes to the screen are properly recognized by assistive technology.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>While JavaScript's association with (X)HTML gives it a high potential for accessibility, as with any programming language, user interface functionality written in JavaScript requires testing. This should include testing with:</p>
        <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
          <li>Screen Readers (See <a href="#g4">PG 4</a>)</li>
          <li>Keyboard-only Access (See <a href="#g6">PG 6</a>)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This testing is easy to perform and provides experience with the types of user interfaces that we can expect for all users in emerging and future technologies.</p>
        <p>Note: Unless otherwise indicated, when JavaScript is mentioned in this document, it means JavaScript that runs within HTML or XHTML pages on the client-side.</p>

        <h3>PDF's Potential</h3>
        <p>Some PDF files are simply images of a document, without any real text, like a photo of a page in a book. While these files often allow users to zoom in on the document for easier reading, the documents are largely inaccessible to people with visual impairment.</p>
        <p>However, since PDF Version 1.4, it has been possible create documents that are compatible with assistive technologies, like screen readers, by placing a structure of tags, very similar to HTML tags, behind a PDF document:<br>
          <img src="images/pdf_tags.png" width="359" height="293" alt="The tags panel presents a hierarchy of tags that describe the structure of a PDF document, including Sect, Title, Heading 1, P, and Figure."></p>

        <p>As in HTML, it is possible even to make very detailed accommodations for accessibility, such as semantic mark up for complex data tables, including special attributes for telling screen readers exactly which data cells should be associated which header cells. When you use these tags and follow accessibility guidelines, PDF can be highly accessible with screen readers and can be keyboard accessible.</p>
        <p>Abobe Reader offers an array of features for text resize, magnification, and adjusting text colors. These work well for simple clean documents, but not very well for complex documents with multiple columns and boxes of text. While in HTML, users can apply custom style sheets to separately customize the appearance of different types of items (headings, lists etc) this is not possible in PDF with Adobe Reader as of <mark>Version 10.1</mark>.</p>
        <p>There are automated tools that help transform inaccessible PDF documents (even those that are just images of documents) into tagged PDF files. To fully take advantage of PDF's accessibility features, human review is required and most often PDF documents need post processing in Adobe Acrobat (version 6 or later). For complex documents with, for example, data tables, lists and links, this post-processing can be time-consuming.</p>
        <p>If the document originates in another program, such as Microsoft Word, following best practices in that program (like using heading styles and lists properly) can:</p>
        <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
          <li>Result in passably accessible documents in some simple cases
          <li>Reduce the amount of post-processing need in Acrobat
        </ul>

        <h4>Screen Reader Compatibility</h4>
        <p>Screen reader compatibility is available on Mac (VoiceOver) and Windows (JAWS, NVDA, <mark>WindowEyes</mark>). <mark>Access to the tagging structure is not available when reading PDF on iOS. On Android, you need to download special players to even access the speech using TalkBack. But, iOS and Android accessibility is improving rapidly, so it this may improve soon.</mark></p>

        <h4>Documentation for PDF accessibility</h4>
        <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
          <li>The Pearson Guidelines include PDF techniques.

        <h3><mark>Flash and Flex's Potential</mark></h3>
        <p>Flash and Flex can be accessible, but it will not happen by accident, by checking "make movie accessible" in the Flash Authoring tool, or by including alternative text in an HTML embed tag. Like HTML, Flash / Flex accessibility requires specific detailed consideration during development.</p>
        <p>Flash and Flex accessibility techniques are considerably less widely known among developers compared with HTML accessibility techniques. As such, accessible Flash is not likely to come from a vendor who does not have specific experience developing accessible Rich Internet Applications.</p>
        <p>If you do want to work with a vendor who does not have accessibility experience, provide the following:</p>
        <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
          <li>Detailed Requirements for Flash Accessibility</li>
          <li>Accessibility Acceptance Testing (Make it clear upfront that you will not accept builds that don't include accessibility features for the functionality that is present. All too often developers attempt to tack-on accessibility at the end of the project, which typically results in a poor level of accessibility or causes accessibility to be perpetually pushed to a later release. Flash accessibility is not a separate feature to be developed independently of other functionality. While it can often be added after the fact, that actually involves revisiting and adapting objects and functionality and takes longer than including accessibility upfront. Flash developers who know how to accomplish Flash Accessibility include accessibility during development. Leaving it for later increases cost, increases schedule time and is a good sign that the vendor does not quite know how to accomplish accessibility in Flash.)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The easier option is to use a vendor who has experience with Accessible Rich Internet Applications. The effort it takes to find and choose a vendor who has accessibility experience, is likely to pay off in other ways, as writing accessible Flash and Flex requires a professional understanding of Flash or Flex and often involves understanding, using, and even rewriting libraries.</p>
        <p>It has been possible to create accessible Flash applications since Flash MX and the Flash Player 6; however, as implementing accessibility features targeted for the Flash Player 8+ has drastically reduced development time, these guidelines will provide techniques targeting Flash Player 8+.</p>
        <p>Some effort has been made to support accessible Flash in Firefox and some online sources indicate that Flash is accessible in Firefox. However, as of March 2009, the support is not stable. So, currently, Flash accessibility for screen reader users requires Internet Explorer on Windows. Since this is the platform support by the screen readers that are used by the vast majority of screen reader users, JAWS and Window-Eyes, this is not as problematic as it may seem at first.</p>
        <p>As with any programming language, user interface functionality written in ActionScript requires testing. This should include testing with:</p>
        <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
          <li>Screen Readers (See PG 4)</li>
          <li>Keyboard-only Access (See PG 6)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This testing is easy to perform and provides experience with the types of user interfaces that we can expect for all users in emerging and future technologies.</p>

        <h3>Android Applications's Potential</h3>
        <p>Android applications developed using Android 4.1 and later can be made accessible with the Android development framework. For more information on developing accessible Android applications see <a href="https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/accessibility/index.html">Android Accessibility API Guide</a>.</p>
        <p>With each new release of Android, new features to help users with disabilities are added. These features and settings can be found under the settings in the Accessibility option. Since the operating system can be changed by the device manufacture, some features may or may not be available on all devices. In Android Lollipop, the following features are available:</p>
        <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
          <li>Talkback and Explore by Touch</li>
          <li>Switch Access</li>

          <li>Bluetooth keyboard, touch, and gestures</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>iOS Applications's Potential</h3>
        <p>All iOS applications developed using iOS 3.0 and later can be made accessible with the UI Accessibility programming interface. For more information on developing accessible iOS applications see Accessibility Programming Guide for iOS.</p>
        <p>With each new release of iOS, new features to help users with disabilities are added. These features and settings can be found under the General settings under Accessibility option. In iOS8, the following features are available:</p>
        <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">

      <h2 id="g2">Guideline 2. Allow users to adjust time limits (Time Limits)</h2>
      <div class="guideline_content">
        <p class="summary">Allow users to adjust short-term (20 hours or less) time limits to at least ten times the default.</p>
        <p>Note: If this would invalidate a timed activity, see <a href="#g3">Pearson Guideline 3</a>.</p>

        <h3>Rationale</h3>
        <p>Some users will need more time to complete activities than the average user. They may have a learning disability that causes reading or processing of information to take longer. Or, they may have a physical disability that slows access to the product.</p>
        <p>A time limit that causes a user to lose work or to return to the login page may create a frustrating cycle that prevents the user from completing the activity.</p>
        <p>"Twenty hours or less" and "ten times the default" were chosen based on the WCAG 2.0 guidelines, which were developed based on clinical research.</p>

        <h3>Techniques</h3>
        <p>Options Quoted from WCAG 2.0 (SC 2.2.1)</p>
        <blockquote><ul>
          <li>Turn off: The user is allowed to turn off the time limit before encountering it; or</li>
          <li>Adjust: The user is allowed to adjust the time limit before encountering it over a wide range that is at least ten times the length of the default setting; or</li>
          <li>Extend: The user is warned before time expires and given at least 20 seconds to extend the time limit with a simple action (for example, 'press the space bar'), and the user is allowed to extend the time limit at least ten times;</li>
        </ul></blockquote>
 
        <h3>K-3 Techniques</h3>
        <p>Students in the earliest grades may not be able to judge how much time they will need. A solution to this is to measure the student's ability to respond to a prompt or to activate a button through an introductory activity. Then, automatically adjust the timing for the main activity based on that data. This requires user-testing. Controls to further adjust timing should still be made available.</p>

This provides just enough additional time to account for performing the mechanics of the activity (e.g. reading, writing, operating a computer) with a disability. So, schools often assign accommodations such as "time and a half" or "double time".</p>

        <p>This type of issue can be resolved without changing the visual layout. For example, in HTML, we restructure the underlying source code. In Flash, we indicate a reading order by numbering elements behind the scenes.</p>

        <h3>HTML &amp; JavaScript</h3>
        <h4>Layout Tables (legacy)</h4>
        <p>The reading order for a layout table begins with the first cell in the first row. In left-to-right languages, like English, this is the left-most cell in the top row. The cell adjacent to that cell is next, and so on. Then the second row is read in the same way. The image below shows the reading order for a layout table in a left-to-right language:<br>
        <img width="276" height="181" alt="A table is read from left to right. First row: first and second cells. Second row: third, fourth and fifth cells. Third row: sixth cell." src="images/Table_order.png"></p>
        <p>This is actually the source code order. If your content does not make logical sense following that order:</p>
        <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
          <li><p>Update to a CSS layout where the source code order is logical</p>
 OR</li>
          <li>Reorganize the table layout so that the contents appear in a logical order in the source code. And, add <code>role="presentation"</code> to the opening <code>&lt;table&gt;</code> tag for layout tables to prevent screen readers from announcing the table structure.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>CSS Layouts</h4>
        <p>The reading order follows the source code order in html and xhtml, regardless of how the items are arranged on the page using CSS. So, be sure to place elements and content in a logical reading order in the source code. This will also make your page readable when CSS positioning is over-ridden, turned off, or not available.</p>
        <p>A common challenge occurs when Web developers wish to have a horizontal list of letters or numbers situated at the right side of the screen. Often they place these links in the source code backwards (for example, z through a), and then they use CSS <code>float:right</code> to float each item to the right. Since z is first, it floats all they way to the right and the rest of the letters follow, line up and look correct visually. <mark><a href="PG4CSS2.html">Open example of incorrect use of float: right in a new window</a>.</mark> However, the links are backwards for screen reader users and users who have turned off CSS. To resolve this, put the links in a-z order in a <code>div</code> element. Then, size the <code>div</code> so that it is only just large enough for the links. Finally, apply CSS <code>float:right</code> to the <code>div</code>. <mark><a href="PG4CSS2FIX.html">Open example of corrected use of float:right in a new window</a>.</mark></p>

        <h4>When JavaScript and/or CSS is used to Place Elements on the Page</h4>
        <p>As mentioned above, the reading order in HTML follows the source code order. So, if you use JavaScript to write source code, as you might do using <code>document.write</code> or by setting innerHTML, just add it in a location where it makes sense. Similarly, if elements are typed into the html source and then hidden or shown using JavaScript, as you might do using display:none and display:block, just place them in the source code according to the order in which the page should be read.</p>
        <p>However, if you use Document Object Model coding to add elements to the page, the reading order might not follow the source code order. When objects are created and stored in variables, the order in which the code is written is not relevant. Instead, the structure of the Document Object Model itself will determine the reading order. Within each object in the Document Object Model, starting with the document object, child nodes are read in order from the first node to the last node (<code>x.childNodes[0], x.childNodes[1] ... x.lastChild</code>). As each child object is encountered, its children are read in a similar fashion, so that the tree is read as shown in the following example, where a <code>div</code> object contains the following child objects:</p>
        <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--ordered">
          <li> some text ("a text node" in DOM terminology)</li>
          <li> a link</li>
          <li> an ordered list with three child list items</li>
          <li> an image with an alt attribute</li>
        </ul>
        <p><img width="400" height="230" alt="The items are read in the following order: the text node, the link, the ordered list items (first through third) and finally the image." src="images/DOM_order.png"><br>
        So, when dynamically adding nodes to the document object model (e.g. appendChild, insertBefore, replaceChild) place them in a logical location in the document tree. For example, if a newly added paragraph should be read just before an ordered list with id L, you might add it as follows:</p>
        <pre><code>
/* Create paragraph */ 
var newP = document.createElement("p");
/* Backslash below escapes line break */
var PText = document.createTextNode("This \
            list will help with the questions \
            you missed!");
newP.appendChild(PText);
/* Get existing ordered list  */
var existingL = document.getElementById("L");
/* Get parent of existing ordered list  */
var parentObj = existingL.parentNode 
/*Place new paragraph inside the parent of the ordered list, just before the ordered list  */
parentObj.insertBefore(newP, existingL);</code></pre>
        <p>And, in this example, a new paragraph is created and is placed just after an ordered list with id <code>L</code>:</p>
        <pre><code>
/* Create paragraph */
var newP = document.createElement("p");
var PText = document.createTextNode("Good job with the list; now take a break!");
newP.appendChild(PText);
/* Get existing ordered list  */
var existingL = document.getElementById("L");
/* Get parent of existing ordered list  */
var parentObj = existingL.parentNode
/* Get the next sibling of the existing ordered list */
var nextS = existingL.nextSibling
/* don't worry if there's a chance nextS will be null - see below */
/* Place new paragraph inside the parent of the ordered list,  just after the ordered list  */
parentObj.insertBefore(newP, nextS);
/* if nextS is null, insertBefore will place newP at the end of parentObj, which would be just after the existing ordered list, in that case. */</code></pre>
 
        <h3><mark>Flash &amp; Flex</mark></h3>
        <p><mark>Reading order in Flash and Flex is set according to an algorithm that chooses the next item to read based on which item is top-most and/or left-most. As such, if you have a purely vertical layout, the movie will be read from top to bottom. This is often a sensible reading order. Similarly, if you have a purely horizontal layout, the movie will be read from left to right, which again, is often a sensible reading order. However, when there are both vertical and horizontal elements, the reading order often becomes nonsensical and confusing.

If you test your movie or application in JAWS and the reading order makes sense, there is nothing else that you need to do to meet PG 4. 

If you test your movie or application in JAWS and the reading order does not make sense, you will need to set the tabIndex for each item in your movie that should be read with a screen reader. TabIndex in Flash/Flex works differently from the tabindex property in HTML. In Flash/Flex, when correcting the reading order, you must set the tabIndex for every element that a screen reader should read, including buttons, links, form fields, other active element, and any text elements.

You can set tabIndex in the accessibility panel in the Flash authoring tool.
You can also set tabIndex using action script: myObject.tabIndex = 10;
You can set tabIndex in MXML (Mark-up used in Flex Builder, Flex Server, or Flash Builder Applications): <code>&lt;mx:Text x="35" y="27" tabIndex="10" text="Welcome Students!" /&gt;</code>
You can skip numbers when setting tabIndex. So, counting by 10 is wise, as it allows you to insert items in the middle of the reading order without renumbering every item. For example, if you realize you need a new item between the items with tabIndex 20 and 30, you can use a tabIndex of 25.</mark></p>
        <h4><mark>Additional Details</mark></h4>
        <p><mark>In order to set the reading order using tabIndex, you will need to avoid using static text. In addition, there are special considerations regarding instance names, off-screen elements, and embedded movies. See <a href="http://www.adobe.com/accessibility/products/flash/reading.html">Adobe's Flash Reading Order Guide (new window)</a> for additional details.</mark></p>

        <h4><mark>Common Misconception</mark></h4>
        <p><mark>Many developers worry that setting tabIndex this way will force keyboard access users to tab to each bit text while trying to reach a button, link or form control. This is true in HTML, but this is not the case in Flash and Flex. TabIndex does not change whether or not an element is treated as an active element for keyboard access.</mark></p>

        <h3>Android Applications</h3>
        <p>The reading over is based on an algorithm which finds the nearest neighbor in a given direction. The reading order and focus order can be modified if it's not correct based on the layout of the page.</p>
<h4>Reading order and focus order MUST follow a meaningful sequence for TalkBack and Keyboard users.</h4>
<h5>Controlling Reading and Focus Order for TalkBack Users with accessibilityTraversalBefore and nextFocusForward</h5>
<pre><code>
android:accessibilityTraversalBefore="@id/button"
android:nextFocusForward="@+id/button"  
</code></pre>
<h5>Grouping content into logical announcements</h5>
<p>Android's developer docs on accessibility cover <a href="https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/accessibility/apps.html#grouping-content">Grouping Content</a> by creating natural groupings and organizing content into single announcements using android:focusable="true".
<p>If users should treat a set of elements as a single unit of information, you can group these elements in a focusable container.
  <pre><code>
&lt;RelativeLayout
    android:id="@+id/song_data_container"
    android:layout_width="wrap_content"
    android:layout_height="wrap_content"
    android:focusable="true"&gt;

    &lt;TextView
        android:layout_width="wrap_content"
        android:layout_height="wrap_content"
        android:id="@+id/song_title"
        android:text="@string/song_title" /&gt;

    &lt;TextView
        android:layout_width="wrap_content"
        android:layout_height="wrap_content"
        android:id="@+id/singer"
        android:layout_toRightOf="@id/song_title"
        android:text="@string/singer" /&gt;
    ...
&lt;/RelativeLayout&gt;
</code></pre>
        <h3>iOS Applications</h3>
        <p>The reading order in iOS applications is defined by the order in which the elements are added to the screen. In the individual, table or custom container views, the order is set by the order in which they are defined in the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/accessibility/uiaccessibilitycontainer">UIAccessibilityContainer</a> protocol array.  To change the reading order use <code>accessibilityElementAtIndex</code>, <code>accessibilityElementCount</code> and <code>indexOfAccessibilityElement</code>.</p>
<h4>Grouping content to correct reading order with shouldGroupAccessibilityChildren</h4>
<p><a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/objectivec/nsobject/1615143-shouldgroupaccessibilitychildren">shouldGroupAccessibilityChildren</a> is a Boolean value indicating whether VoiceOver should group together the elements that are children of the receiver, regardless of their positions on the screen.
<p>For example, consider an app that shows items in vertical columns. Normally, VoiceOver would navigate through these items in horizontal rows. Setting the value of this property to true on the parent view of the items in the vertical columns causes VoiceOver to respect the app’s grouping and navigate them correctly.

        <h3>PDF in Acrobat</h3>
        <img style="float:right" alt="" src="images/tags-tree.jpg">
        <p>The reading order in a PDF document is determined by the order of the tags in the tags tree.</p>
        <p>If the reading order of the PDF document is not sensible, simply drag the tags for the elements into the desired order in Acrobat's tags panel. This will not affect the visual layout.</p>
        <p>The location of the tags panel will vary depending on your version of Acrobat. In Acrobat 9 Pro, for example, you can find the panel at View &gt; Navigation Panels &gt; Tags.</p>
        
        <h3 style="clear:both;">Word</h3>
        <p>The reading order in a Word document is often fine and cannot be modified as it can in HTML or a PowerPoint presentation. In Word, content is read top-down, left-right. Tables are also read in this order which works well for typical data tables but can cause similar issues as HTML tables when used for layout.</p>
        <p>To avoid empty paragraphs, use paragraph spacing and column breaks for fine control of text placement. This will reduce how often screen readers such as JAWS says blank when navigating with reading keys.</p>

        <h3>Text Boxes and Floating Images</h3>
        <p>Avoid using text boxes and floating images. Screen readers often do not read the content of text boxes and do not announce their presence. When using images, use "inline" text wrapping to ensure that they are read with the text in the correct order. Images that float in front of the text have the same issues as text boxes.</p>

        <h3>PowerPoint</h3>
        <p>The reading order in PowerPoint is determined by the order shown in the selection pane, <strong>and that order is from the bottom to the top of the list of elements</strong>. Use the buttons in the selection pane to arrange the items properly. Consider making this adjustment for each master slide layout of the template to reduce future work.</p>
        <p>When adding any new elements to a slide, check the reading order to ensure that it presents the content in a way that makes sense. In PowerPoint 2007 and 2010, use the selection pane. The reading order is the order in which the shapes are listed starting with the bottom-most item to top.<br>
        <img width="450" height="282" alt="Go to Home menu and choose select in the editing menu.  In the drop down menu, choose Selection Pane.  Use the re-order buttons to move content in the list." src="images/PowerPoint-ReadingOrder.jpg"></p>
        <p>In PowerPoint 2003, the reading order is determined using the outline panel and the drawing order. The outline panel provides an outline of the text content that appears on the slides. For content that does not appear in the outline panel, tab through the elements of the slide to verify the order. To change the order, right click and element and choose Order. This command is also available on the Drawing toolbar. As with all versions of PowerPoint, save time by ensuring that the order of the master slide layouts is correct before adding slides.</p>

In that case, the reading order would alternate between the sign-in and the register sections. Also, lists of numbered or lettered links aligned to the right are often in a backwards reading order.

        <p class="summary">Ensure that screen reader users can find new dynamically-added content (e.g. expanding menus, alerts, error messages, hints that appear on rollover).</p>

        <h3>Rationale</h3>
        <p>When the content of page changes once the page has loaded, some accessibility concerns arise that are not addressed by accessibility guidelines for static content:</p>
        <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
          <li>How will a screen reader user who may already have read much of the page know that the new content is now available?</li>
          <li>How will a screen reader user know where to find the new content?</li>
          <li>Will common screen reader applications recognize changes to the page?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Since dynamic content changes and additions are most often designed and tested by users who can see a large portions of the screen at once, these features most often work well for such users. These features can also work well for screen reader users, but they must be designed and tested with this type of access in mind.</p>

        <h3>HTML &amp; JavaScript</h3>
        <h4>Error Messages that Appear without a Page Refresh | Custom Alert Windows that don't Contain Buttons or other User Interaction</h4>
        <p>The goal is to alert screen reader users to the new information. In addition, especially if the feedback appears while the user is typing into a field, the goal will be to provide the error message without moving the screen reader user's focus (i.e. without taking the text-insertion point out of the form field).</p>
        <p>The WAI-ARIA "alert" role makes this possible. Simply make <code>role="alert"</code> an attribute of <strong>both</strong>:
        <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
          <li><p>The outer-most container that is added to the page</p>
            <p>~AND~</p></li>
          <li>The parent element of that element. Create a container just for the purpose of receiving the alert. (Needed for Safari with VoiceOver as well as, the lower priority configuration, Window-Eyes with IE)</li>
        </ul>
        <p><mark>To support TalkBack with Chrome on Android devices add <code>aria-live="assertive"</code> to the container element that will receive the alert. Although not a top priority configuration, this is also needed to support NVDA with IE.</mark></p>

        <p>This will cause screen readers to speak the error or alert when it appears visually. But, it won't make any change to the screen reader user's location on the page. So, for example, if a user is typing a password when the message is read, the user can continue to type that password, uninterrupted.</p>
        <p>In screen magnifiers, sometimes the magnification level is so high that only a small section of the screen is shown at once. Magnifiers can be set to move focus to alerts and this will cause the error message or the upper left corner of the error message (in left-to-right languages) to be shown on the screen. Because of this, the upper left corner (or upper right in right-to-left languages) of the alert object should show the beginning of the error message.</p>
        <p>Note: <code>role="alert"</code> has no effect if it is just on the page when the page loads. The role only comes into play when the area is updated without a page refresh. As such, when an identical page, except for an added alert message, is loaded, different techniques are needed. See the section just below on this topic.</p>

        <h4>Error Messages that Appear with Page Refresh</h4>
        <p>In this scenario, screen reader users will hear that a new page has loaded. Because of this, the error message is not actually dynamically-added content! However, particularly if the page is the very same page shown again, it is good usability for screen readers users to make it easy to locate the error message. Some combination of the following techniques should be used:</p>
        <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
          <li>Most often, screen readers read the title of the page when the page loads. So, it is helpful to including all or part of the error message in the page title.</li>
          <li>The most common way that screen reader users explore a new page is that they read the headings on the page. Making all or part of the error message a heading is very helpful.</li>
          <li>Screen reader users often tab from form element to form element, hearing the form label for each form element. In cases where detailed form error messages are provided for each form field, including those errors as part of the form label can be a helpful technique. See <a href="g14">Pearson Guideline 14</a> for techniques on how to code form labels so that they will be read when screen reader users tab to form elements.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you allow the page to load without the error message, and then add the error message using JavaScript after the page has fully loaded, you can use the <code>role="alert"</code> technique described in the section just above.</p>

        <h4>Standard JavaScript Alert, Confirm, and Prompt Messages</h4>
        <p>Common screen readers and screen magnifiers should be able to handle these without any special coding.</p>
        <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
          <li>Confirm: <code>var r=confirm("Continue?");</code></li>
          <li>Alert: <code>alert('Please login first');</code> OR</li>
          <li>Prompt: <code>var name=prompt("Please enter your name","");</code></li>
        </ul>
        <p>For information on using these and for examples, see: <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_popup.asp">w3schools.com's JavaScript Popup Windows (opens in new window)</a>.</p>

        <h4>Custom Dialogs that need to be Dismissed by the User | Custom Modal Windows</h4>
        <p>When the dialog appears, use JavaScript to move focus to the interactive element in the dialog that is most likely to be used first. When the dialog is closed, be sure to return focus to a logical location, such as the control that caused the dialog to appear.</p>
        <p>If the dialog serves an "alert" function, add the following two attributes to the outermost element that is added to the page when the message appears:</p>
        <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
          <li><p><code>role="alertdialog"</code></p> 
            <p>~AND~</p></li>
          <li><code>aria-describedby="id"</code> where <code>id</code> is the id of the message you want read automatically when the alert dialog first appears.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If the dialog isn't really an "alert" and is more of just a separate window, add the following two attributes to the outermost element that is added to the page when the message appears:</p>
        <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
          <li><p><code>role="dialog"</code></p>
            <p>~AND~</p></li>
          <li><code>aria-label="my message"</code> where <code>my message</code> is the message you want read automatically when the dialog first appears OR <code>aria-labelledby="id"</code> where <code>id</code> is the id of the message you want read automatically when the alert dialog first appears. (Yes, aria-labelledby should have the repeated letter l.)</li> 
        </ul>
        <p>These attributes tell screen readers and screen magnifiers to announce these additions to the screen as alert dialogs or as dialogs. Some screen readers will also switch into "forms mode" for navigation of the dialog. In this mode, the dialog is announced and then screen reader users move between active elements, often skipping inactive content. So, be sure that all content in the dialog is included through <code>aria-describedby</code>, <code>aria-label</code>, or <code>aria-labelledby</code> and/or through form labels. Form labels are discussed in detail in <a href="#g14">Pearson Guideline 14</a>.</p>
        <p>For older configurations that don't support <code>role="alertdialog"</code> or <code>role="dialog"</code>, try to give an overview of the purpose of the dialog with the control that gains focus. For example, you might use "stay on this page" as your button text, instead of something less descriptive, such as "stay".</p>

        <h4>Buttons that Reveal Content (e.g. expanding menus, expanding help topics)</h4>
        <p>One of the simplest techniques is to place the new content in the reading order just after the control that initiated the change.</p>
        <p>It is important that users will know whether the section is expanded or collapsed. See <a href="#g20">Pearson Guideline 20</a> for information on this.</p>

        <h4>When Important Information Appears on Mouse Over</h4>
        <p>Often information is coded to appear <code>onmouseover</code> and <code>onfocus</code>. For example, when a mouse is pointed at a book cover image, a <code>div</code> element might appear as a box that provides more information about the book.</p>
        <p>This information is at risk of being inaccessible to screen reader users. It only appears in the reading order for a short time, often while the screen reader is reading other content. You will have to decide if the information should always be read by the screen reader. If the information is essential or particularly brief, it is likely it should always be read, so you might:</p>
        <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
          <li>Include the information as alt-text for a related image, OR</li>
          <li><p>Keep the information visible to screen readers even when it is hidden for visual users by placing the information off-screen:</p>
          <pre><code>.screen_readers_only {
  position:absolute;
  left:-999px;
  top:auto;
  width:1px;
  height:1px;
  overflow:hidden; }</code></pre></li>
        </ul>
        <p>If the information is rather long and not necessary for a basic understanding of the page, it might be best if it is not part of the general reading order. To allow the content to be read on-demand only:</p>
        <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
          <li><p>Include the information in the <code>longdesc</code> attribute of a related image:</p>
          <pre><code>&lt;img src="weather_today.gif"
  alt="Sunny 73 degrees"
  longdesc="weather_detail.html&gt;"</code></pre> OR</li>
          <li><p>Place the information on a second page and provide a link placed off screen so that the link is only available to screen reader users:</p>
          <pre><code>a.screen_readers_only {
  position:absolute;
  left:-999px;
  top:auto;
  width:1px;
  height:1px;
  overflow:hidden;
}</code></pre></li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Areas that Update Periodically (e.g. News Feed, Social Features)</h4>
        <p>First, place the new content in a predictable consistent location within the page structure. The containing structure for this content should have a heading that tells the user what the section is for. Consider including the following information:</p>
        <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
          <li>That the area is dynamic</li>
          <li>Which conditions that will cause an update</li>
          <li>Which content is currently present (or newest)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For example:</p>
        <pre><code>&lt;h2&gt;Hourly News as of 1 PM Today&lt;/h2&gt;</code></pre>
        <p>In this case, a screen reader user will know that the section may be updated and can use heading reading techniques to scan the headings on the page and discover whether an update has been made.</p>
        <p>If all or part of the heading is not needed for sighted users, you can hide the heading as follows:</p>
          <pre><code>h2.hidden {
  position:absolute;
  left:-999px;
  top:auto;
  width:1px;
  height:1px;
  overflow:hidden;
}</code></pre>
        <p>Second, particularly for social features, there should be a way for students or instructors to be notified that new information is available. The following techniques are some options. You may wish to allow your users to select an option in user preferences.</p>
        <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
          <li>Make any text that announces the new content into an alert by placing role="alert" on the outermost HTML element that is added to the page when the icon or the alert appears. For example: <code>&lt;div role="alert"&gt;You have a new message&lt;/div&gt;</code></li>
          <li>Play a beep or a tone when a new message appears. (Thanks to Michael Brooks of Penn State University for suggesting this technique and for pointing out that this has worked well for some students.)</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Progress Bars and Loading Messages</h4>
        <p>If you know the percent progress, <a href="progressbar.html">use a progress bar as is shown here</a>. Of course, the visual can be whatever you like. While the WAI-ARIA specification implies that a variety of types of values may one day work, this only works in current screen readers/browser with percent values.</p>
        <p>If you don’t know the percent progress, and the load times are very short, one possibility is to use an alert that says "Page is loading" and then move focus to the new content when it is ready.</p>
        <p>If you don’t know the percent progress and if the load times are longer, chose what you think is a max load time for the activity, then create a time-base version of this where the progress bar reaches 100% at that max time. This way, most of the time, the progress will be better than what the bar reports, which is fine. Have the progress bar code loop (start over at 0%, once it reaches 100%), just in case there is a very long load time.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/complete#progressbar">Read more about progress bars in the WAI-ARIA spec</a></p>

        <h3>Android Applications</h3>
        <p>The goal is to help Talkback (the Android screen reader) users know about the important information. When the application interface elements change dynamically, the <code>contentDescription</code> and <code>hint</code> property should be updated to reflect the current state of the interface element. If the dynamically-added content should be read by the screen reader, move focus to that component on the page so it will be read by Talkback.</p>
        <h4>TalkBack users MUST be notified of dynamic content changes either through spoken accessibility announcements OR focus management.</h4>
<p>Android has different methods to speak content changes to TalkBack users including native controls that are already accessible like Toast messages. There's an accessible announcements property similar to WAI-ARIA in HTML called <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View.html#attr_android:accessibilityLiveRegion">android:accessibilityLiveRegion</a>="assertive" or "polite". You can also speak any text strings aloud using announceForAccessibility. It's also possible to move focus directly to the element you want spoken with AccessibilityEvent.TYPE_VIEW_FOCUSED.
</p>

        <h3>iOS Applications</h3>
        <p>When the application interface elements change dynamically, the <code>accessibilityLabel</code> and <code>accessibilityHint</code> should be updated to reflect the current state of the interface element.</p>
        <p>If the layout of the application screens change or if there is an event that happens on the screen, use the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/accessibility/uiaccessibility">UIAccessibilityNotifications in the UIAccessibility protocol</a> to send status notifications to VoiceOver to help users navigate the new layout.</p>
<h4>Using UIAccessibilityAnnouncementNotification to Speak Messages</h4>
<pre><code>
DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter(deadline: .now() + 0.1) {
//need delay to hear announcement with voiceover
    UIAccessibilityPostNotification(UIAccessibilityAnnouncementNotification,
    self.errorText.text) //anounces the error message text
}  
</code></pre>
<h4>Using UIAccessibilityLayoutChangedNotification to Set Focus to Elements</h4>
<pre><code>
UIAccessibilityPostNotification(UIAccessibilityLayoutChangedNotification,
self.errorText) // send focus to the error text
</code></pre>
        <p>For more information, see the section in the iOS Accessibility Programming Guide called <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/iPhoneAccessibility/Making_Application_Accessible/Making_Application_Accessible.html">Make Dynamic Elements Accessible</a>.</p>

        <h3>PowerPoint</h3>
        <p>PowerPoint presentations can have dynamic content in the form of slide animations. Be sure to test animations with a screen reader because a content is not always read consistently. It is best to use animations triggered by mouse clicks so that it can be controlled by the user during a slideshow. Animations triggered by mouse clicks can be controlled using both a mouse and keyboard.</p>

        <h3>Related Guidelines</h3>
        <h4>WCAG 2.0 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value</h4>
        <p>For all user interface components (including but not limited to: form elements, links ,and components generated by scripts), the name and role can be programmatically determined; states, properties, and values that can be set by the user can be programmatically set; and notification of changes to these items is available to user agents, including assistive technologies. (Level A)</p>
        <p>Note: This success criterion is primarily for Web authors who develop or script their own user interface components. For example, standard HTML controls already meet this success criterion when used according to specification.</p>

      <h2 id="g6">Guideline 6. Check keyboard access (access without a pointing device) and correct any issues (Keyboard Access)</h2>
      <div class="guideline_content">
        <p class="summary">Ensure that keyboard keys (instead of a mouse and instead of touch screen gestures that require eye-hand coordination) can be used to:</p>
        <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
          <li><strong>Reach and operate all controls</strong></li>
          <li>AND <strong>Navigate through active elements, following the reading order</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Notes:</p>
        <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
          <li>This guideline does <strong>not</strong> mean that an on-screen keyboard must always be visible on mobile devices. Test on mobile devices using a physical keyboard and using the gestures that are part of the screen reader functionality.</li>
          <li>Keyboard access is primarily the responsibility of the user agent (e.g. Web browser, PDF reader, Flash player). To address this guideline, we ensure that our content supports the user agent's solution.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Rationale</h3>
        <p>By ensuring that our content supports keyboard access, we provide access to a number of user groups who do not use a mouse.</p>
        <p>Additional Benefit: Many mobile device users also rely on keyboard access.</p>

        <h3>General Techniques</h3>
        <h4>The Basics</h4>
        <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
          <li>Make sure that keyboard-only users can get to each active element (e.g. link, form field, control). This is usually accomplished using tab keys and arrow keys.</li>
          <li>Just getting to links and controls is not enough, make sure keyboard-only users can also activate each active element (e.g. link, form field, control). This is usually accomplished using enter key or space bar.</li>
          <li>Finally, make sure that keyboard-only users can escape each element to return to other items on the page.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Be Mindful that Learning New Key Presses can be Burdensome</h4>
        <p>Wherever possible, use the keyboard access methods and keys that are the default in the particular technology you are using, rather than inventing new access methods that users will need to learn.</p>

        <h4>Hidden Content</h4>
        <p>Make sure that hidden active elements (e.g. links, form fields, controls) are not part of the tab order. It can be be very frustrating and disorienting to have to press tab again and again to step through hidden content. Users may assume that there's no keyboard access at all.</p>

        <h4>Do Not Require Physically Skilled Key Pressing</h4>
        <p>Do not require users to hold down keys for a certain amount of time or to accomplish any other specific timing of key presses.</p>

        <h4>MouseOver Effects</h4>
        <p>Provide equivalents for keyboard access users when MouseOver effects:</p>
        <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
          <li>provide information or reveal new user interface elements</li>
          <li>provide a different (e.g. clearer, simplified, larger) view of information</li>
          <li>provide functionality</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Category Drag &amp; Drop</h4>
        <p>When users need to put items into categories, one approach is to have a menu of categories pop up when the user tabs to one of the items and hits enter.</p>
        <p>The Up and Down Arrow Keys allow the user to select between categories in the menu. Hitting Space Bar selects the category and so drops the item into that category. Tab and Shift Tab can move the user to the next item or previous item.</p>
        <p><mark>(the modern keystrokes are: spacebar to select an item; enter and/or ctrl+m to drop an item. Tab or arrows to move around between focusable draggables or destinations).</mark><br>
        <img width="230" height="155" src="images/fruNveg.jpg" alt="Example: Users drag words like 'olives' and 'tomatoes' into two categories: 'Fruits' and 'Vegetables."></p>

        <h4>Matching Drag &amp; Drop</h4>
        <p>When users need to match elements of one list with elements of another list, users will need a way to select an item, jump easily to the other list, and then select the matching item. Users should be able to begin from either list. Simple keystrokes can be used to allow this. Tab and Shift Tab can be used to jump back and forth between the lists. Up and Down Arrow Keys can be used to move within the list. Enter can be used to select items to drag (or begin matching line). And Space can be used to select locations to drop (or complete matching line). This way, if a user choses an item, but then decides not to match that item yet, they can select another item using Enter.<br>
        <img width="254" height="127" src="images/nvda.jpg" alt="Example: Users draw lines between words by dragging words from one list to words in another list."></p>

        <h4>Fill-in-the-Blanks Drag &amp; Drop</h4>
        <p>When an exercise allows a user to choose from a list of words and drag those words into blanks in a paragraph, a key part of working through the answers is being able to glance back at the list of words while reading the paragraph. To provide a parallel experience for screen reader users, one strategy is to provide a special view where the blanks are replaced with pull down menus. This will also be useful for people who do not use a mouse because of mobility or dexterity issues.<br>
        <img width="260" height="160" src="images/dragNdrop.jpg" alt="Example: Users drag words from a list into a paragraph with blanks."></p>

        <h4>Details</h4>
        <p>Add a link, such as "Use Activity without a Mouse" to the user interface. Make sure link is just after the drag-and-drop instructions in the reading order, so that screen reader users can find it quickly.<br>
        <img width="670" height="407" src="images/drag_fill_before.jpg" alt=""></p>

        <p>When the "Use Activity without a Mouse" link is clicked, replace the blanks with pull down menus and replace the link with a link such as "Use Drag and Drop".<br>
        <img width="681" height="407" src="images/drag_fill_after.jpg" alt=""></p>

        <h3>HTML</h3>
        <h4>In-Page Links</h4>
        <p>When coding in-page anchor links, code the target of the in-page link using an <code>a</code> element with <code>tabindex="-1"</code>. This ensures that you will avoid two bugs in Internet Explorer (versions 5-8) that break keyboard access. Without <code>tabindex="-1"</code> many inpage links will appear to work visually when first activated, but when the user tries to move forward using the tab key, the user is brought back to the skip link instead of moving forward on the page.</p>

        <h4>Image Maps</h4>
        <p>When creating image maps, use <code>usemap</code>, <code>&lt;map&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;area&gt;</code>. Do not use <code>ismap</code> or the x and y coordinates provided by <code>input type="image"</code> to create image maps. Browsers allow keyboard access users to tab to area elements, but do not support selecting a location using the keyboard in image maps created using <code>ismap</code> or <code>input type="image"</code>.</p>
        <p>Note: Image maps that use <code>area</code> elements are often called client-side image maps, while the others are often called server-side image maps. Despite the terminology, only maps created using <code>area</code> elements offer keyboard access, regardless of whether you add server-side or client-side scripting to <code>ismap</code> or <code>input type="image"</code>.</p>

        <h4>Considerations if you are changing the tab order</h4>
        <p>Allow the tab order to follow the reading order. (This occurs automatically, unless you change the tab order.) Tab orders that have been set based on <code>tabindex</code> are difficult to maintain. They can cause a mismatch between the tab order and the reading order. This can be disorienting for screen reader users. Unless screen reader usability testing with skilled screen reader users is planned, do not reset the tab order using <code>tabindex</code>.</p> 

        <h4>Keyboard Shortcuts</h4>
        <p>Common browsers allow <code>accesskey</code> attributes to override keyboard access to browser menus. <code>Accesskey</code> attributes can also override the keystroke commands that allow keyboard access with a screen reader. Do not use <code>accesskey</code> unless:</p>
        <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
          <li><p>You use only numeric <code>accesskey</code> values (0-9)</p>
            <p>~OR~</p>
          </li>
          <li>The access keys are not active by default. Instead, the user can switch them on after reviewing the list of keys in user preferences.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>New Browser Windows</h4>
        <p>If you are opening a new browser window, it is <strong>not</strong> necessary to provide keyboard shortcuts to close or minimize the window. Instead, you <strong>should</strong> rely on the operating system's keyboard commands for adjusting windows.</p>
        <p>Here are the commands used for Windows and Mac:</p>
        <table class="pe-table">
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th scope="col">Operating System</th>
              <th scope="col">Minimize</th>
              <th scope="col">Close</th>
              <th scope="col">Menu of Options</th>
            </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <th scope="row">Windows</th>
              <td>Alt Space, then n</td>
              <td>Alt F4</td>
              <td>Alt Space</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <th scope="row">Mac</th>
              <td>Command m</td>
              <td>Command w</td>
              <td></td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>
    
        <h3>JavaScript</h3>
        <p>Be Careful using <code>blur()</code> ("Stop the Ants")</p>
        <p>Do not trigger <code>blur()</code> for an element in response to an <code>onFocus</code> event for that element. This prevents keyboard access for the element. This mistake is often made when developers wish to remove the outline that appears around a link when the link is clicked. Instead, use the following CSS code to remove that outline in modern browsers (e.g. Firefox 3+, Internet Explorer 8+).</p>
        <pre><code>
a:active {
  outline-width: 0;
}</code></pre>
        <p>The CSS above uses <code>a:active</code>. Do NOT use <code>a:focus</code> or even just <code>a</code> in the code above, as this would hide the focus indicator (See <a href="#g7">PG 7</a>).</p>

        <h4>Select Menus and OnChange</h4>
        <p>Avoid using select menus with <code>onchange</code> handlers where the handler changes focus or causes an irreversible event like sending a message or submitting a form. In such cases just rely on a "Go" button instead of an onchange handler.</p>
        <h5>Here are the problems with select menus and <code>onchange</code> handlers:</h5>
        <p>In Internet Explorer, if you use arrow keys to move up or down in a select menu with an <code>onchange</code> handler, the <code>onchange</code> event triggers with each move. If that handler changes focus you will be moved away from the select menu with one up or down arrow; if it results in some irreversible action, then, just by an innocuous move in a menu, you have caused that action. On the other hand, if you first use alt+down-arrow to open the select menu and then use arrow keys in the open list, no <code>onchange</code> event fires until you press enter or tab out of the menu. This situation is aggravated by the fact that the most popular screen reader says, "Combo box, to change the selection use the arrow keys." This particular problem is specific to Internet Explorer.</p>
        <p>For other browsers (Chrome, Firefox, and Safari) and for Internet Explorer when alt+down-arrow is used to open the menu, the <code>onchange</code> event does not trigger until you press enter or tab out of the control. So for all of the browsers, when you tab out of the open select menu, the corresponding on-change action, possibly irreversible, is taken and you might have thought that you were just leaving the control. Again, use the "Go" button in such cases.</p>

        <h4>Custom Controls</h4>
        <p>Make sure that custom controls are keyboard accessible using one of these techniques:</p>
        <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
          <li><p>(BEST) Start with HTML/XHTML elements that are interactive by default (e.g. a, <code>button</code>, <code>input</code>*). For example, you may wish to have a box that acts as a control that changes the page. Instead of making a <code>div</code> element interactive, you might use a <code>button</code> element. This way, you take advantage of well-tested standard keyboard access that comes with elements that are interactive by default. You can use CSS to adjust the <code>button</code> element to appear as you wish:</p> 
            <pre><code>button.myactivebox {
  width: 3em;
  height: 3em;
  float: left;
  /* remove browser-provided 3d edge effect */
  border: 0;
  /* remove color assigned by browser */
  background: transparent;
  /* add basic link-style cursor for mouse users*/
  cursor: pointer;
}</code></pre>
            <p>* The following elements require additional consideration and so may not be the best choice as a base for your custom control: <code>input type="submit"</code> or <code>input type="image"</code>. For these elements, the onClick event can be triggered if a user presses enter anywhere within the form, or anywhere within the page if there are no <code>&lt;form&gt;</code> tags. (This won't happen, though, if the focus is on a natively active element, like a link, when the user presses Enter, which is why these elements are appropriate for use with typical forms.) Also, in some browsers, these elements automatically cause a page refresh. See <a href="#g10">PG 10</a> for tips on avoiding changing the user's place on a page unexpectedly.</p></li>
          <li>Or, you might use scripting to make an element that is not normally interactive into an interactive element. This requires considerable careful consideration for keyboard access. First, give the element a <code>tabindex="0"</code> attribute. This way, the element will be included in the natural tab order. And, be sure to follow the coding tips below. Unlike natively active elements, these items won't be keyboard accessible if you only use onClick and they may cause problems if there are submit buttons nearby:
            <ol class="pe-list.pe-styled-lists--ordered">
              <li> While browsers allow the keyboard to trigger <code>onclick</code> events for active elements, they typically do not allow the keyboard to trigger <code>onclick</code> events for elements that are not normally active. So, add an <code>onkeypress</code> event if needed. Be sure to code the <code>onkeypress</code> event so that it only triggers an action if the <strong>appropriate</strong> key is pressed (usually the enter key). See "When using <code>Onkeypress</code>, <code>Onkeydown</code>, or <code>Onkeyup</code>" below for more detail on the key-related events.</li>
              <li>Screen readers will not automatically know the purpose of the element. So, include text that is available to screen readers that indicates the purpose of the element and how to interact with it. (<a href="#g20">PG 20</a> explains further.) This is a case where testing the user experience with a screen reader is essential.</li>
              <li>Be sure this type of artificially active element never appears within a form that has a submit button (e.g. <code>input type="image"</code>, <code>input type="submit"</code>). When a user presses enter within a form, elements designed to submit the form will be triggered, including any <code>onClick</code> handlers on those elements. If there are no form tags, this will happen if enter is pressed anywhere on the page. The one exception is if a natively actively element (e.g. link, button) has focus at the time. This allows keyboard access users to use links and buttons within a form, but this exception does not apply if an active element was created using an element that is not normally active (e.g. <code>div</code>, <code>span</code>) . So, a keyboard access user will not be able to "click" on such custom elements, without triggering the form submit.</li>
              <li>In Firefox, <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> elements (without <code>href</code> attributes) that have been made active through scripting do not automatically gain focus indicators. See <a href="#g7">PG 7</a> for more on focus indicators and how to add them when needed.</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Selecting Particular Points</h4>
        <p>The HTML techniques for this PG explain that image maps can be keyboard accessible if you use <code>area</code> elements instead of using the x and y coordinates provided by <code>input type="image"</code> or <code>ismap</code>. For more complex JavaScript (or server-side) functionality where you would need 30, 40 or more <code>area</code> elements, though, <code>area</code> elements may not be appropriate as keyboard access users would have to tab through all of those <code>area</code> elements.</p>
        <p>In such cases, if you use the x and y coordinates provided by <code>input type="image"</code> or <code>ismap</code>, provide equivalent functionality for keyboard access users through buttons and controls. For example, if users need to plot points on a graph, you might provide text entry fields where the x and y coordinates of each point can be entered.</p>
        <p>Another option is using layers of elements if you detect that the user is using keyboard access. For example, at first the graph might be made up of four <code>input type="image"</code> elements. If any are clicked using the mouse, the x and y coordinates might be used. But if one is selected using the keyboard, it might be replaced by a set of 4 smaller area elements, and so on, until the keyboard user is able to select the particular point needed.</p>

        <h4>Clearing Default Text in a Form Field</h4>
        <p><mark>Do not clear user-entered text in form fields when focus is placed on the field. Screen reader users, in particular, may move backwards through the fields to check their entries just before submitting the form. If you write a script designed to clear the placeholder text, be sure to check the value of the text, and only clear the text if it really is just the placeholder text.</mark></p>
        <p>Another option is to use the HTML 5 <code>placeholder</code> attribute. If you support browsers where this is not implemented, you might use JavaScript for those browsers only. This article shows how to use JavaScript for browsers that don't support <code>placeholder</code> while still using clean HTML 5 tagging: <a href="http://webdesignerwall.com/tutorials/cross-browser-html5-placeholder-text" target="_blank">Open Web Designer Wall Article in a New Window</a>.</p>

        <h4>When using <code>Onkeypress</code>, <code>Onkeydown</code>, or <code>Onkeyup</code></h4>
        <p><code>Onkeypress</code>, <code>onkeydown</code> or <code>onkeyup</code> are triggered in some browsers by any key press at all, including key presses commonly used for keyboard access and screen reader navigation. For example, in some browsers, if a link opens a new window on key press, keyboard access users won't be able to tab past the link because focus will always move to the new window. When using natively active elements, <code>onclick</code> is sufficient for both mouse access and keyboard access as the Enter key fires the <code>onclick</code> event for keyboard access users. So, it is usually best to avoid using <code>onkeypress</code>, <code>onkeydown</code> or <code>onkeyup</code>. If you do use these, be sure:</p>
        <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
          <li>The functionality is purely decorative (inconsequential) and doesn't change focus.</li>
          <li>Or, you use JavaScript to ensure that actions only occur when particular keys are pressed and either:
            <ul>
              <li>You are only taking over the keys commonly used for ordinary components (arrow keys and enter) only when focus in on a custom control and the user can tab off of the custom control. (Note: to do this across browsers you need to use <code>onkeydown</code> instead of <code>onkeypress</code>.)</li>
              <li>You are taking over keys no matter where the user is on the page, but the functionality is not active by default. Instead, it is made active through user preferences. The users should be able to read which keys would be over-ridden. This way, they can avoid activating the functionality if the keys would interfere with their access method.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Android Applications</h3>
        <p>Android applications can be used with touch using <a href="https://support.google.com/accessibility/android/answer/6006598?rd=1">navigation gestures</a> and with a Bluetooth keyboard. It is recommended that interactive elements have a touch target of 48dp which is a physical size of about 9mm (for more information see <a href="https://material.io/guidelines/layout/metrics-keylines.html">Metrics and Grids</a>).</p>
        <p>The application works with touch and a Bluetooth keyboard when its <code>android:focusableattribute</code> to set to true. Android provides ways to control which controls are focusable using <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View.html#setFocusable(boolean)">setFocusable()</a> and <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View.html#isFocusable()">isFocusable()</a> and allows focus to be set to control using <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View.html#requestFocus()">requestFocus()</a>.</p>
        <p>The order in which controls receive focus is determined by the focus order which is based on an algorithm that finds the nearest neighbor in a given direction. This can be changed using <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View.html#attr_android:nextFocusDown">android:nextFocusDown</a>, <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View.html#attr_android:nextFocusLeft">android:nextFocusLeft</a>, <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View.html#attr_android:nextFocusRight">android:nextFocusRight</a>,and <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View.html#attr_android:nextFocusUp">android:nextFocusUp</a>. At runtime, the focus order can be changed using methods such as <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View.html#setNextFocusDownId(int)">setNextFocusDownId()</a> and <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View.html#setNextFocusRightId(int)">setNextFocusRightId()</a>.</p>
        <p>Touch events should only be triggered when touch is removed from the control and the ACTION:DOWN trigger should be avoided.</p>
        <p>For more information:</p>
        <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">

        </ul>

        <h3>iOS Applications</h3>
        <p>iOS applications allow users to use touch to navigate the screens and provides limited access through a Bluetooth keyboard unless VoiceOver is used in conjunction with the Bluetooth keyboard. For touch and gesture navigation, provide a minimum 44 X 44 point hit target area and avoid crowding the items too closely together. This will allow users to easily access a specific UI element.</p>
        <p>Standard interface elements are automatically touch accessible with and without the VoiceOver screen reader. Touch events should only be triggered when touch is removed from the control and the <code>touchesBegan:withEvent</code> should be avoided. Custom container and individual views must be made accessible in order for users to be able to interact with the interface elements.</p>

        <h4>How to make custom views accessible</h4>
        <p>There are two ways to make a custom individual view accessible:</p>
        <ol class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--ordered">
          <li>Set the custom view's accessibility status in the code that instantiates it</li>
          <li>Implement the <code>isAccessibleElement</code> method of the <code>UIAccessibility</code> protocol in the custom subclass</li>
        </ol>
        <p>For custom container views, each interface element needs to be made accessible individually.  The container view should not be made accessible since users interact with the interface elements and not with the container itself.  To make container view interface elements accessible, implement the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/accessibility/uiaccessibilitycontainer">UIAccessibilityContainer</a> protocol.</p>

        <h3>PDF in Acrobat</h3>
        <p>Keyboard access in PDF is generally fine in Acrobat. Ensure that the tab order for active elements including links and form fields is correct.</p>
        <h4>Tab Order</h4>
        <p>The tab order in a PDF is determined by the page properties and the order of the tags in the tags tree. <br>
          <img width="285" height="257" src="images/page-properties.jpg" alt=""></p>
        <p>The location of the pages panel will vary depending on your version of Acrobat. In Acrobat 9 Pro, for example, you can find the panel at View &gt; Navigation Panels &gt; Pages. Select all the pages in the document. Select Page Properties in the navigation panel options menu and choose a tab order option. For tagged documents, always use "Use Document Structure" option.</p>

        <h3>PowerPoint</h3>
        <p>Keyboard access is controlled by PowerPoint. No special consideration is required within the content to make it accessible by keyboard. Verify that the reading order is correct so that users can navigate the content in the correct order.</p>
        <p>In PowerPoint, navigate with these keyboard shortcuts:</p>
        <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
          <li>Start slideshow - F5</li>
          <li>Next animation / slide - enter, page down, right or down arrow, spacebar</li>
          <li>Previous animation / slide - page up, up or left arrow</li>
          <li>Previous slide - P</li>
          <li>Go to slide in slideshow - type page number + enter</li>
        </ul>
        <p>When testing with JAWS, use these keyboard shortcuts to speak content:</p>
        <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
          <li>Next word - Insert + right arrow</li>
          <li>Next line - down arrow</li>
          <li>Next sentence - alt + down arrow</li>
          <li>Whole page - insert + down arrow</li>
          <li>Next list item - i</li>
          <li>Speak slower / faster - alt + ctrl + page down or page up</li>
        </ul>
 
        <h3>Flash &amp; Flex</h3>
        <p>In Flex, sometimes you'll find that the tab order does not match the reading order. To correct this, arrange the items in the source code so that they appear in the source code in the same order as your reading order.</p>

        <p>2.1.1 Keyboard: All functionality of the content is operable through a keyboard interface without requiring specific timings for individual keystrokes, except where the underlying function requires input that depends on the path of the user's movement and not just the endpoints. (Level A)</p>
        <p>Note 1: This exception relates to the underlying function, not the input technique. For example, if using handwriting to enter text, the input technique (handwriting) requires path-dependent input but the underlying function (text input) does not.</p>
        <p>Note 2: This does not forbid and should not discourage providing mouse input or other input methods in addition to keyboard operation.</p>
        <h4>WCAG 2.0 A – SC 2.1.2 No Keyboard Trap:</h4>
        <p>If keyboard focus can be moved to a component of the page using a keyboard interface, then focus can be moved away from that component using only a keyboard interface, and, if it requires more than unmodified arrow or tab keys or other standard exit methods, the user is advised of the method for moving focus away. (Level A)</p>
        <p>Note: Since any content that does not meet this success criterion can interfere with a user's ability to use the whole page, all content on the Web page (whether it is used to meet other success criteria or not) must meet this success criterion. See Conformance Requirement 5: Non-Interference.</p>
        <h4>WCAG 2.0 A – SC 2.4.3 Focus Order:</h4>

      <h2 id="g7">Guideline 7. Ensure keyboard access visibility (Keyboard Access Visibility)</h2>
      <div class="guideline_content">
        <p class="summary">Ensure that the user's location on the page will be visually apparent when keyboard keys are used to move from item to item.</p>
        <p>Note: This is primarily the responsibility of the user agent (e.g. Web browser, PDF reader, Flash player). To address this guideline, we ensure that our content does not interfere with the user agent's solution.</p>

        <h3>Rationale</h3>
        <p>Users with mobility impairment often use keyboard access without screen readers. When using keyboard access, the user is not pointing to a particular location on the page. Instead, they are moving through links and controls without specifying the order in which each item will receive focus. As such, they need to be able to see where focus is on the page.</p>
        <p>Most user agents provide a visual effect called a focus indicator that differentiates the item that currently has focus:</p>
        <h4>HTML links in Firefox 3:</h4>
        <img width="91" height="65" alt="box drawn with thin blue dashes surrounds blue link text" src="images/html_links_ff3.png">
        <h4>HTML links in Safari 3:</h4>
        <img width="91" height="65" alt="box drawn with thick fuzzy blue lines and rounded corners surrounds the link text" src="images/html_links_s3.png">
        <p>Some form elements have special focus indicators. For example, a text field that is in focus will contain the text cursor as shown in IE 6 below:</p>
        <img width="400" height="61" alt="A short, but wide white rectangle represents the text input field. In the field, far to the left, is a vertical black line, a visual representation of the input cursor. " src="images/text_cursor_ie6.png">
        <p>However, it is possible to obscure the focus indicator through visual effects or through the layout of the content.</p>
        
        <h3>General Techniques</h3>
        <p>If the focus indicator is not visible, we have two choices in most media types:</p>
        <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
          <li>Correct the reason the default focus indicator is not visible</li>
          <li>Add a new focus indicator. Decorative mouse-over effects can often be reused for this.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>HTML &amp; JavaScript</h3>
        <ol class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--ordered">
          <li>Test to be sure the focus indicator is visible in each supported browser.</li>
          <li>If the focus indicator is partially hidden due to the layout, adjust your CSS to accommodate the focus indicator. For example, if you increase the padding the focus indicator may be hidden by neighboring elements:
              <p><img width="118" height="92" alt="Only the upper right corner and the left side of the focus rectangle are visible. The rest is hidden by the padding of neighboring links." src="images/neighboring_elements.png"><br>
              This is because the focus indicator surrounds the padding in block elements. So, in this case, you might use the margin property in place of padding. The focus indicator does not surround margins.</p></li>
          <li>If the visual design makes the focus indicator difficult to see on your supported browsers, create your own visual effect for the on-focus state. The link in the image below is a grey box that has focus in Firefox 2. The focus indicator is nearly invisible, a good candidate for a custom visual effect:
              <p><img width="162" height="205" alt="The focus indicator in Firefox 2 is a black dashed line, so it blends into the dark grey box it surrounds and can barely be seen." src="images/custom_visual_effect.png"><br>
              If you've ever created a mouse-over effect, creating an on-focus effect will seem familiar:</p>
              <p>OR</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Use the CSS :focus class as you would use the CSS :hover class:
                  <pre><code>
/* mouse */
a:hover {
  background-color: #FFFFCC;
}
/* keyboard */
a:focus {
  background-color: #FFFFCC;
}</code></pre>
                  <p>Since a:focus doesn’t work in IE (as of IE 7) you may want to add  a:active in addition to a:focus:</p>
                  <pre><code>
/* keyboard */
a:focus {
  background-color: #FFFFCC;
}
a:active {
  background-color: #FFFFCC;
}</code></pre>
                </li>
                <li>Use the JavaScript event handler <code>onFocus</code> as you would use the event handler <code>onMouseOver</code>. Also use <code>onBlur</code> as you would use <code>onMouseOut</code>.
                  <pre><code>
&lt;a href="filename.html"
  onmouseover="JavaScriptCodeOn();"
  onfocus="JavaScriptCodeOn();"
  onmouseout="JavaScriptCodeOff();"
  onblur="JavaScriptCodeOff();"&gt;
</code></pre>
                  <p>OR</p>
                  <pre><code>
&lt;a href="filename.html"
  onmouseover="JavaScriptCodeOn();"
  onfocus="this.onmouseover"
  onmouseout="JavaScriptCodeOff();"
  onblur="this.onmouseout"&gt;
</code></pre>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          <li>The "outline" for <code>onfocus</code> is in fact the default focus indicator. So, do not remove the "outline" for the onfocus state using CSS styling.</li> 
        </ol>
        <h3>Android Applications</h3>
          <p>When a user uses either swipe gestures or a Bluetooth keyboard, a visible indicator on the screen should show the current element that has focus. This is done by default for standard elements. Custom elements should set the style when <code>state_focused="true"</code>.</p>
          <p>Android provides several elegant ways to change the visual appearance based on state:</p>
            <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
              <li>Change color: <a href="https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/resources/color-list-resource.html" target="_blank">Open Google's Color State List Resource in a new window.</a></li>
              <li>Change images: <a href="https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/resources/drawable-resource.html#StateList" target="_blank">Open Google's  Drawable State List Resource in a new window.</a></li>
            </ul>
        <h3>iOS Applications</h3>
          <p>iOS provides a visible focus indicator for elements that receive keyboard input.</p>
          <p>When a user uses swipe gestures with VoiceOver, the element on the page that has VoiceOver focus will have a black rectangle outline. This focus indicator is determined from the property which is a subclass of <code>UIView</code>. Objects should not override the visual focus indicator or set the <code>accessibilityFrame</code> property to <code>nil.</code></p>
        <h3>PDF in Acrobat</h3>
          <p>In the link properties, specify the link appearance.</p>
          <img width="339" height="267" alt="" src="images/link_appearance.jpg">
          <p>It is important to have the following settings:</p>
          <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
            <li><strong>Link Type</strong> – Visual Rectangle</li>
            <li><strong>Highlight Style</strong> – Inset</li>
            <li><strong>Line Thickness</strong> – Thin</li>
            <li><strong>Line Style</strong> – Underlined</li>
            <li><strong>Color</strong> – Set a color that has 4.5:1 color ratio between the text color and text background color. See <a href="#g26">PG26</a> for more details on color contrast.</li>

          <p>These are the basic keyboard interactions that typically work for Web products. If your application uses only these, there is no need to provide special keyboard access instructions:</p>
          <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
            <li>Tab and Shift Tab to bring elements into focus</li>
            <li>Enter or Spacebar to activate elements</li>
            <li>Arrow Keys to select radio buttons, checkboxes or menu items</li>

      </div>

      <h2 id="g9">Guideline 9. Support navigation within the page (In-page Navigation)</h2>
      <div class="guideline_content">
        <p class="summary">When distinguishable features or sections (e.g. navigation, main content, individual news articles) appear on a page or in a document, provide a way to navigate to the features or sections using a screen reader and the keyboard.</p> 

        <h3>Rationale</h3>
        <p>Mouse users commonly navigate Web pages by skimming the page visually. When they see a feature of interest, they can immediately read the text there and use a mouse to access interactive elements there.</p>
        <p>So, designers might not think about in-page navigation unless a page contains a very long list that is not pleasant to skim visually, such as a glossary. </p>
        <p>However, keyboard access users (with and without screen readers) move through a page, item by item, starting at the top. So, for example, if 40 links appear before the link the user wants, the user may have to press tab 40 times to reach the desired link.</p>
        <p>Similarly, if there are many articles on the page, screen reader users may have to listen to a lot of content before finding the article of interest.</p>
            <p>In-page navigation addresses these issues.</p>
            <p>Additional Benefits: In-page navigation is useful for users without disabilities as well. If a student needs to check a fact on a long page of text, jumping from heading to heading is much faster and more pleasant than watching for the heading needed while scrolling the page.</p>

          <h3>HTML &amp; JavaScript</h3>
          <h4>Headings (h1 through h6)</h4>
          <p>Organize pages using HTML headings (e.g. <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;h3&gt;</code>). This allows screen reader users to jump from heading to heading to read and interact with the content under each heading only as needed.</p>
          <p>If desired, you can use CSS to change or remove all formatting associated with these heading elements:</p>
          <pre><code>h2.nostyle_inline {
    /* 1em results in the same font size that
    would be used for plain text in that
    location on the page */
    font-size: 1em;
    /* standard font weight */
    font-weight: normal;
    /* no extra space */
    padding: 0;
    margin: 0;
    /* With display set to inline,
    headings can appear inline with other
    text. For example, bold text at the
    beginning of a paragraph might
    serve as a heading. */
    display: inline; 
} </code></pre>
          <p>If necessary for visual effects, you can also use an image within a heading tag. (See <a href="#g21">PG 21</a> regarding images of text.)</p>

          <pre><code>
&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;img src="sea_mammals.gif" alt="Mammals of the Sea"&gt;
 &lt;/h1&gt;</code></pre>
          <p>But, don't use heading tags like <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> for the headers inside tables. See <a href="#g11">Pearson Guideline 11</a> for the correct semantic markup for tables.</p>

          <h4>WAI-ARIA Headings (not recommended)</h4>
          <p>It is now possible to mark HTML elements as headings without using the traditional HTML heading tags. This even works in many screen reader/browser combinations. However, the traditional HTML heading tags are still supported in many more places. So, if you can use the traditional tags, that is the best option for universal accessibility.</p>

          <p>These headings are defined through two attributes:</p>
          <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
            <li><code>role="heading"</code></li>
            <li><code>aria-level</code></li>
          </ul>
          <p>For example, to create the equivalent of an <code>h2</code> element, you could type: <code>&lt;div role="heading" aria-level="2"&gt;</code>.</p>

          <h4>Using Headings in HTML 5</h4>
          <p>There was a proposal in HTML5 for the user agents (browsers) to assist with setting correct heading levels automatically (for use cases like syndication, where a piece of content with a heading could be placed anywhere within another document) using an algorithm known as the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Using_HTML_sections_and_outlines">HTML5 Document Outline</a>. This idea came from the general heading element <code>&lt;h&gt;</code> proposed in XHTML, and in HTML5 the idea was to allow special sectioning elements (<code>section</code>, <code>article</code>, <code>aside</code>, <code>nav</code>...) to adjust the semantic heading level based on nesting.</p>
          <p>This Document Outline is still mentioned in the WHATWG HTML specification (<a href="https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/83">see current issue</a>), however the reality is that currently <a href="https://developer.paciellogroup.com/blog/2013/10/html5-document-outline/">no user agents nor Assistive Technology support this</a> (JAWS did support some version of this but it was removed in JAWS 15), and there are warnings in <a href="https://idpf.github.io/a11y-guidelines/content/xhtml/headings.html">ePub guidelines</a> and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/sections.html#outlines">W3C specs</a>.</p>

          <p>For this reason, the current recommendation is to <a href="http://adrianroselli.com/2016/08/there-is-no-document-outline-algorithm.html">continue to use h1 through h6 as needed</a>.</p>
          <p>One thing for developers to be aware of is that while the <strong>semantics</strong> of the Document Outline have not been added to user agents, some of the styling ideas have been. Following the code examples on the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/sections.html#outlines">MDN page</a>, developers may see changes in default heading size (generally smaller than what corresponds to the actual level), so developers are also encouraged to set explicit sizes if headings are nested in section or article elements.</p>

          <h4>WAI-ARIA Landmarks</h4>
          <p>Often navigation menus, banners, and footers are not preceded by a visible heading because it is visually clear what they are. WAI-ARIA landmark roles can be used to identify these areas and allow screen readers users to navigation to them.<br>
          <img width="350" height="252" alt="In an example page layout, banner stretches across the page, followed by navigation, which contains search. Under that, main is on the left and complementary on the right. ContentInfo marks a page footer." src="images/simple_landmarks.jpg"></p>
          <p>Landmark roles are simple to add to a page. Below are the definitions of each role quoted from <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/">WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices 1.1, W3C Working Group Note 14 December 2017</a>.</p>
          <dl class="side-bar-box">
            <dt><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/#aria_lh_banner"><code>banner</code></a></dt>
            <dd>"A region that contains the prime heading or internal title of a page."</dd>
            <dt><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/#aria_lh_complementary"><code>complementary</code></a></dt>
            <dd>"Any section of the document that supports but is separable from the main content, but is meaningful on its own even when separated from it."</dd>

            <dd>"Meta information which applies to the first immediate ancestor whose role is not presentation."</dd>
            <dt><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/#aria_lh_form"><code>form</code></a></dt>
            <dd>"A region of the document that represents a collection of form-associated elements, some of which can represent editable values that can be submitted to a server for processing."</dd>
            <dt><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/#aria_lh_main"><code>main</code></a></dt>
            <dd>"Main content in a document."</dd>
            <dt><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/#aria_lh_navigation"><code>navigation</code></a></dt>
            <dd>"A collection of links suitable for use when navigating the document or related documents."</dd>
            <dt><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/#aria_lh_region"><code>region</code></a></dt>
            <dd>"A perceivable section of the page containing content that is sufficiently important for users to be able to navigate to the section."</dd>
            <dt><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/#aria_lh_search"><code>search</code></a></dt>
            <dd>"The search tool of a Web document."</dd>
          </dl>
          <p>Each of the roles below should be used at most once per document:</p>
          <ul  class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
            <li><code>banner</code></li>
            <li><code>main</code></li>
            <li><code>contentinfo</code></li>
          </ul>
          <p>In most cases, that means they can each be used only once per HTML page. However, in some cases, a single HTML page may contain multiple items with role="document," and this would allow more per HTML page. We recommend that objects with these 3 roles be disjoint. In other words, they should not contain each other.</p>
          <p>Add the role attribute to an object that <strong>contains</strong> the corresponding section of the document:</p>
          <pre><code>&lt;div role="main"&gt; ... Main Content Here ... &lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>
          <p><img src="images/labeled_landmarks.jpg" width="350" height="252" alt="In this example, there are two areas marked with role='navigation'. One has aria-label='Site' and the other has aria-label='Chapter'"><br>
          If you use more than one of the same role, such as two navigation landmarks, provide labels distinguishing the two using an <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/complete#aria-label"><code>aria-label</code></a> attribute or an <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/complete#aria-labelledby"><code>aria-labelledby</code></a> attribute. <mark>While these labeling techniques are not yet widely supported, they work in JAWS 12 in our testing and will likely work in more screen readers soon.</mark></p>

          <h4>Some implementation suggestions and tips</h4>
          <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
            <li>There are still screen readers in use today that do not support these roles, so be sure to still include at least a heading or a skip link to take the user to the main content.</li>
            <li>If you use some landmarks, we recommend that you cover every major section of the page using one role or another.</li>
            <li>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/complete#region"><code>region</code></a> landmark can be used if an area of your page needs a landmark and cannot use any of the roles defined above. Be sure to give it a label with <code>aria-label</code> or <code>aria-labelledby</code>.</li>
            <li>There shouldn't be too many landmarks on a page. Just the main 2-6 page sections should be landmarks.</li>
            <li>The application role changes screen reader navigation behavior dramatically and should not be used simply to provide a landmark.</li>
          </ul>

          <h4>HTML 5 Elements that Sometimes Act as Landmarks (nav, footer, aside, section, header, article, form)</h4>
          <p>While WAI-ARIA landmarks are the most reliable way to create landmarks, it is important to note that some HTML 5 elements are announced as landmarks in some screen readers. The HTML 5 specification does not make it clear which elements should act as landmarks. Supplemental documentation does discuss this, but the current screen reader implementations do not match this documentation.</p>
          <p>It is pretty clear that the intention is that <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code> will act as a landmark.</p>
          <p>To move forward in this environment we suggest the following:</p>
          <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
            <li>Include WAI-ARIA landmark markup for the following HTML 5 section elements when you want them to be used as landmarks:Most likely, you will not want <code>&lt;form&gt;</code> to act as a landmark.
              <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered"> 
                <li>&lt;footer role="contentinfo"&gt;</li>
                <li>&lt;header role="banner"&gt;</li>
                <li>&lt;nav role="navigation"&gt;</li>
                <li>&lt;aside role="complementary"&gt;</li>
                <li>&lt;section role="region"&gt;, or a more specific role if appropriate.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Finally, note that in some cases elements with <code>role="article"</code> and <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> elements are being treated as landmarks.</li>
           </ul>

          <h4><mark>Frames</mark></h4><mark>keep until Mastering has stopped use??</mark>
          <p>Traditional HTML Framesets provide one level of in-page navigation since keyboard users can jump between frames (usually using F6 and Shift F6) on a Web page. This does not apply to inline frames (<code>iframe</code>). If your site uses framesets and the main content frame has headings, your site probably meets <a href="#g9">Pearson Guideline 9</a>.</p>

          <h4>Skip Links</h4>
          <p>This is an older technique that would be deprecated if only browsers supported heading and landmark navigation without a screenreader or browser extension. </p>

          <p>If your site has many pages with the same structure, you might supplement heading navigation by providing a small number of anchor links at the top of the page that allow users to jump to the main areas of the page. Just as consistent page design would allow sighted users to focus immediately on the main content area as they move from page to page, a link might bring screen reader users to the "main content" on every page. This is particularly helpful in sites without frames where the headings in the main content area vary from page to page. </p>
          <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
            <li><strong>Do not create mini-menus of these links;</strong> no more than two, maybe three, should be in any particular location</li>
            <li>These links should refer to standard page elements such as 'main content' or 'navigation'.</li>
            <li>Make sure these links are either visible at all times or appear when a user tabs to the links:<br>
              <pre><code>.skiplink {
    position: absolute;
    clip: rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);
    /* for Internet Explorer */
    clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);
    padding: 0;
    border: 0;
    height: 1px;
    width: 1px;
    overflow: hidden;
}
<mark>
    /* :active is needed for Internet Explorer */
    .skiplink:focus, 
    .skiplink:active {
    padding:3px;
    position: static;
    width:auto;
    height:auto;
    clip:auto;
    overflow:initial;</mark>
}</code></pre><br>
              Otherwise keyboard access users who don't use a screen reader won't be able to use the links. They would also have to tab past invisible links, which can be confusing and time-consuming.</li>
          <li>There are bugs in Internet Explorer 5-11 that sometimes make these in-page links fail. Test the skip links by activating each link; then tab again. If the second tab goes to the top of the page or back to your skip link, your skip link is not working. To be sure to avoid this, add tabindex="-1" to the target of the link as shown in the code example below. <mark><strong>There were 2 bugs causing this: one relating to HasLayout, which no longer affects IE versions we support. The other bug however does still hit IE11.</strong></mark><br>
              <pre><code>
&lt;a name="skiptarget" id="skiptarget" tabindex="-1"&gt;
link name here
&lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre></li>
          </ul>
          <p><a href="skiplink.html" target="_blank">Open sample skip link in new tab.</a></p>

          <h4>Tips</h4>
          <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
            <li>If JavaScript is used to change the page structure, be sure to update in-page navigation to reflect the change. For example, if the user can choose to remove the navigation bar and a link allows the user to jump to the navigation bar, the link should also be removed with the navigation bar.</li>
            <li>Do not use the <code>accesskey</code> attribute to meet this guideline. <code>Accesskey</code> can actually block keyboard access. (<a href="#g6">Pearson Guideline 6</a> explains why.)</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Android Applications</h3>
          <p>Android applications are limited on what they can provide for in-page navigation. </p>

          <h4>Screen Title</h4>
          <p>The screen title should reflect the screen contents. The title can be set using the <code>setTitle</code> method.</p>

          <h4>Headings</h4>
          <p>Headings are not available in Android applications. Explicit headers can be provided in list views using <code>HeaderViewListAdapter</code>.</p>

          <h3>iOS Applications</h3>
          <p>There are several ways to support in-page navigation in iOS applications:</p>
          <ol class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--ordered">
            <li>Navigation bar</li>
            <li>Tab Bar Controller</li>
            <li>Headings</li>
          </ol>

          <h4>Navigation Bar</h4>
          <p>The navigation bar provides easy navigation through an information hierarchy and the management of screen contents. To learn more about defining a navigation bar coding practices, see <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/WindowsViews/Conceptual/ViewControllerCatalog/Chapters/NavigationControllers.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40011313-CH2">Navigation Controllers</a>, <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uinavigationcontroller#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40006934">UINavigationController Class Reference</a>, and <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uinavigationbar#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40006887">UINavigationBar Class Reference</a>.</p>

          <p>When the user moves to a new screen, the following should change:</p>
          <ul  class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
            <li>The navigation bar title should change to current screen title which is set using UINavigationItem.</li>
            <li>The label for the back-button must be the previous level’s title.</li>
          </ul>

          <h4>Tab Bar Controller</h4>
          <p>The tab bar controller provides a way for a user to go to different views and allows users to easily move from one section to the next. For more information, see Tab Bar Controllers.</p>
          
          <h4>Headings</h4>
          <p>VoiceOver users will use headings to navigate between elements on the screen. Headings can be defined in iOS6 and later through <code>UIAccessibilityTraitHeader</code>, <code>UITableView</code>, <code>UINavigationBar</code> or content displayed through web view.</p>

          <h3>PDF in Acrobat</h3>

          <h4>Headings</h4>
          <p>Organize the document and set a logical heading structure by using the heading tag for the document title and h1-h6 tags for the section headers. This allows screen reader users to jump from heading to heading to read and interact with the content that interests them.</p>

          <h4>Bookmarks</h4>
          <p>Bookmarks are a set of links which allows a user to see the different sections of the document and easily navigate to them. Every major section in the document should be included as a bookmark.</p>
          <img src="images/bookmarks.jpg" style="float:right;" width="187" height="150" alt="">
          <p>To generate bookmarks, go to the Bookmarks Panel. The process to add bookmarks differs slightly depending on the version of Acrobat and the operating system. <mark>To add bookmarks in Acrobat 9 Pro</mark>:</p>
          <ol class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--ordered">
              <li>Go the Bookmarks Panel at View &gt; Navigation Panels &gt; Bookmarks.</li>
              <li>Select "New bookmarks from structure" from the navigation panel options.</li>
              <li>Select the structure elements to include in the list of bookmarks. The bookmark names come from the title of the tags. If there is no title, the tag content is used.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>If there are bookmarks that should not be included, delete the bookmark in the tree structure. Add missing bookmarks manually by using the New Bookmark option in the navigation panel options.</p>

          <h3 style="clear:both;">Word</h3>

          <h4>Headings</h4>
          <p>Use Word heading styles to organize your document structure. A well-structured document that uses the built-in heading styles allows screen reader users to quickly and easily navigate the content. They can jump from heading to heading to access the information that interests them. </p>
          <p>Beware of formatting in Word documents that makes the content look like a heading visually but does not use heading styles. Such text is interpreted as plain text by the screen reader. These documents have no structure for screen readers.<br>

          <h4>Reference Links</h4>
          <p>Headings are the most widely used in-document navigation method, but tables of content and sometimes indexes are also used.</p>
          <p>When content contains other references such as bookmarks, bibliography entries and table of contents, and footnotes, add them by using the built-in Word features found on the reference menu. Do not create them manually.</p>

          <h3>PowerPoint</h3>
          <p>Screen reader users can navigate in slideshow mode easily with keyboard shortcuts. PowerPoint and JAWS shortcuts are available to read the page, read element by element, or advance the next animation event. See <a href="#g6">PG 6</a> for a partial list of shortcuts.</p>
          <p>However, certain actions are not as intuitive. For example, when a page contains a video or audio clip a user should tab to access the media control. It is possible to add alternate text to the object, but JAWS does not read that text when they tab to put a focus on the media controls. When the focus is on the media object, the user can either select shift-F10 to access the context menu, then Preview or they can press alt-P to play. Test slides with non-standard content layout or interactive objects using a screen reader to ensure that all content is accessible by keyboard.</p>

          <h3>Testing HTML</h3>
          <p>There are three recommended ways to provide in-page navigation in HTML: ARIA landmarks, headings and In-page links ("skip links"). Using the techniques below, see if enough support has been provided so that users can move to any of the primary page areas.</p>

      <h2 id="g10">Guideline 10. Do not change the user's location on the screen unexpectedly (Continuity of  User's Place)</h2>
      <div class="guideline_content">
        <p class="summary">Do not change the user's location (e.g. place on the page, page/url, frame, window or user agent) as follows:</p>
        <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
          <li><strong>When the user moves to (on focus, on mouse over, on touch start) or away from (on blur, on mouse out, on touch end) any element including form control options</strong></li>
          <li>OR <strong>When the user changes the setting of a <abbr title="User Interface">UI</abbr> control, unless each option can be reached by the keyboard without selecting it and it is clear what will happen when the setting is changed</strong></li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Rationale</h3>
        <p>If the user's place in the media changes unexpectedly, it can be disorienting for any user and particularly disorienting for those with cognitive disabilities.</p>
        <p>For keyboard access users, such a change can also mean a significant amount of effort to get back to where they wished to be. As such, for these users, it is particularly frustrating if they cannot control when such changes take place.</p>
        <p>For screen reader users, such a change often means a change in the reading location. This can be confusing during an auditory experience. (Imagine your voice mail jumping from the middle of one message to the beginning of another message in the same person's voice.) For this reason, the user's place on the page should not change unexpectedly.</p>
        <p>Even if some user action triggers the change, the situation is little better if the change is unexpected or unavoidable. (Imagine your voice mail jumping from the middle of one message to the beginning of another message each time you move your mobile phone.)</p>
        <p>Warning or alert boxes that appear suddenly and suddenly gain focus are acceptable, if they are designed to interrupt activities for all users and are easy to dismiss. (Continuing with the voice mail analogy from above, the following message from your voice mail system wouldn't be confusing, after all: "Alert: The voice mail system will be down for the next fifteen minutes. Please call back after 12 pm.")</p>

        <h3>General Techniques</h3>
        <ol class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
          <li>If you change the user's place in the media in order to provide a warning or alert:
            <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
              <li><p>begin the message with text that identifies the message as a warning or alert</p>
                <p>~AND~</p></li>
              <li><p>provide a way to dismiss the message (For example, you might provide a "Close this Alert Box" button.)</p>
                <p>~AND~</p></li>
              <li>if possible, return the user to where they were on the page before the alert occurred.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>When hiding (removing) content that currently has focus, avoid an unexpected change in location by moving focus to some natural position just before or just after the dynamic content in the normal reading order.</li>
          <li>It is the user's perception of their location that is important in this guideline. As such, do not unexpectedly change the content around the user's location to such an extent that they would believe they are on a new page or in a new location on the page.</li>
        </ol>
 
        <h3>Technology Specifics</h3>
        <h4>HTML | XHTML | CSS | JavaScript</h4>
        <ol class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
          <li>Several of the techniques for <a href="#g6">Pearson Guideline 6</a> also speak to this issue.</li>
          <li>If you find that active elements are not in the ideal order when using the tab key to move through the page, correct this by adjusting reading order (see <a href="#g4">PG 4</a>). Do not use JavaScript to force particular changes in focus. For example, if you have three active elements on the page (A, B and C) that should be in that order, using JavaScript to move focus to C when B receives the blur event will violate this guideline. This would cause unexpected changes in focus as keyboard navigation must work both forwards (tab) and backwards (shift + tab). A user might trigger blur on B when moving backwards through the page, hoping to reach A, but this type of JavaScript would bring the user back to C.</li>

      <h2 id="g11">Guideline 11. Use semantic markup for its intended purposes (Semantic Markup)</h2>
      <div class="guideline_content">
        <p class="summary">Identify roles (e.g. heading, numbered list, bulleted list, data table, paragraph, emphasized text) of page elements using conventions for the media type. (And do not misidentify roles by using those conventions solely for their visual effects.)</p>
        <h3>Rationale</h3>
        <p>Media content will be transformed into:</p>
        <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
          <li>Spoken words</li>
          <li>Braille</li>
          <li>Large text</li>
          <li>Custom color-schemes</li>
          <li>Custom layouts</li>
        </ul>
        <p>When the structure of the default layout is created through visual settings alone, it is difficult for software to transform the structure into other forms. However, when elements in the structure are tagged with text or markup that says what they are (i.e. semantic markup), the structure can be carried over.</p>
        <p>For example, a typical visual Web user might use the indentations in a nested list to easily read only the top-level items first. To create parallel ease-of-use for screen reader users, the screen reader application must be able to identify the top-level list items. In HTML, list markup (e.g. <code>&lt;ol&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;li&gt;</code>) allows this with today's screen readers.</p>
        <p>Also, breaking up large blocks of text by marking them as headings, paragraphs, lists, etc helps all users to read the content more easily and is especially helpful for those with learning disabilities or cognitive impairments.</p>

        <h3>HTML &amp; JavaScript</h3>
       
        <h4>HTML | XHTML | CSS</h4>
        <p><strong>Where markup exists to define an element-type, use that markup for that type of element.</strong></p>
        <p>Examples:</p>

        <h4>Headings</h4>
        <p>When a Web Page includes headings, those headings should be marked up as HTML headings. HTML provides 6 levels of headings, which can be used to mark up heading text and to provide an outline structure for your page:</p>
<pre><code>
&lt;h1&gt;Happy Healthy Pets&lt;/h1&gt;
. . .
  &lt;h2&gt;Dogs&lt;/h2&gt;
  . . .
    &lt;h3&gt;Dog Health&lt;/h3&gt;
    . . .
    &lt;h3&gt;Dog Toys&lt;/h3&gt;
    . . .
  &lt;h2&gt;Cats&lt;/h2&gt;
  . . .
    &lt;h3&gt;Cat Health&lt;/h3&gt;
    . . .
    &lt;h3&gt;Cat Toys&lt;/h3&gt;
    . . .</code></pre>
        <p>If needed, use CSS to adjust the appearance of HTML headings:</p>
<pre><code>
h1 {
  /* choose a good font size */
  font-size: large;
  /* Headings don't have to be bold */
  font-weight: normal;
  /* remove all that extra space */
  padding: 0;
  margin: 0;
  /* add back just the space you want */
  margin-top: 13px;
  /* add any other formatting you like */
  text-align: center;
}</code></pre>
        <p>If necessary for visual effects, you can also use an image within a heading tag. (See <a href="#g21">PG 21</a> regarding images of text.)</p>
<pre><code>
&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;img src="sea_mammals.gif" alt="Mammals of the Sea"&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;</code></pre>
        <p><mark><strong>redundant, this is guideline 11</strong> But, don't use heading tags like <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> for the headers inside tables. See Pearson Guideline 11 for the correct semantic markup for tables.</mark></p>

        <h4>Lists (Definition Lists, Ordered Lists and Unordered Lists)</h4>
        <p>When a Web page includes a list, the list should be marked up as an HTML list:</p>
<pre><code>
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Chapter One
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Activity One&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Activity Two&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Chapter Two
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Activity One&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Activity Two&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</code></pre>
        <p>If needed, use CSS to adjust the appearance of HTML lists:</p>
<pre><code>
body &gt; ul {
  /* remove bullets from first-level list directly inside body tag */
  list-style-type: none;
}
body &gt; ul &gt; li {
  /* adjust space between first-level list items */
  margin-bottom: 20px;
  /* Enclose each first-level list item in a box */
  border-style: solid;
  border-width: 1px;
  width: 15em;
  padding: .5em;
}
body &gt; ul &gt; li &gt; ul {
  /* adjust how far second-level items are indented */
  margin-left: 2em;
  padding-left: 2em;
  /* choose a bullet for second-level list items */
  list-style-type: square;
}
/* child selector (&gt;) does not work in IE 6 - 
   use class names if you need to support IE 6 */</code></pre>

        <h4>Tables and Table Headers</h4>
        <p>Header cells for data tables should be marked up using <code>&lt;th&gt;</code> tags and data cells should be marked up using <code>&lt;td&gt;</code> tags. If a cell is both a header cell and a data cell, use <code>&lt;td&gt;</code> tags. (Additional mark-up, described below, will further clarify the purpose of the cell.</p>
        <p>For data tables either <code>scope</code> attributes or <code>id</code> and <code>headers</code> attributes should associate header cells with data cells.</p>
        <p>The <code>scope</code> attribute is easiest way to associate header cells with data cells. When a cell is column header use <code>scope="col"</code> and when the cell is a row header use <code>scope="row"</code>:</p>
<pre><code>
&lt;table border="1"&gt;
  &lt;caption&gt;Average Park Use in 2008&lt;/caption&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;th scope="col"&gt;People&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th scope="col"&gt;Dogs&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th scope="col"&gt;Other Pets&lt;/th&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;th scope="row"&gt;Monday&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;52&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;30&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;th scope="row"&gt;Tuesday&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;40&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;23&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;0&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  . . .
&lt;/table&gt;</code></pre>
        <p>Table Scope Attribute Sample Page: <a href="table_scope_attributes.html">This Window</a> | <a href="table_scope_attributes.html" target="_blank">New Window</a>.</p>
        <p>If a data table is so complex that <code>scope</code> attributes are not sufficient to associate header cells with data cells, simplify the table or break it into a number of simpler tables. If that is not possible, use <code>headers</code> and <code>id</code> attributes to associate header cells with data cells: Assign an <code>id</code> attribute to each header cell. Then give each data cell a <code>headers</code> attribute. The value of the <code>headers</code> attribute should be a space-delimited list of the ids the data cell's headers, as shown below:</p>
<pre><code>
&lt;table . . . &gt;
  &lt;caption&gt;Average Park Use in 2009&lt;/caption&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;th rowspan="2"&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th colspan="2" id="p"&gt;People&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th colspan="2" id="d"&gt;Dogs&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th colspan="3" id="o"&gt;Other Pets&lt;/th&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;th id="adult"&gt;Adults&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th id="child"&gt;Children&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th id="toy"&gt;Toy Dogs&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th id="od"&gt;Other Dogs&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th id="mam"&gt;Mammals&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th id="birds"&gt;Birds&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th id="rep"&gt;Reptiles&lt;/th&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;th id="M"&gt;Monday&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;td headers="adult M"&gt;52&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td headers="child M"&gt;30&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td headers="toy M"&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td headers="od M"&gt;52&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td headers="mam M"&gt;30&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td headers="birds M"&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td headers="rep M"&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;th id="Tu"&gt;Tuesday&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;td headers="adult Tu"&gt;65&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td headers="child Tu"&gt;31&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td headers="toy Tu"&gt;8&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td headers="od Tu"&gt;54&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td headers="mam Tu"&gt;40&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td headers="birds Tu"&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td headers="rep Tu"&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;

        <p><a target="_blank" href="table_headers_id_attributes.html">Open Table Headers and Id Attributes Sample Page in a New Window</a>.</p>
        <p><strong>Do not use semantic tags for visual effects that are not consistent with the meaning of the tag.</strong></p>
        <p>For example, do not use <code>&lt;blockquote&gt;</code> to indent text when the text is not a quotation. And, do not use definition lists for items that are not definitions.</p>

        <h4>Legacy HTML</h4>
        <p>If you use table markup for layout (rather than for tabular data), use only <code>&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;td&gt;</code> without any semantic markup (<code>&lt;th&gt;</code>, <code>scope</code>, <code>headers</code>, <code>&lt;caption&gt;</code>, <code>summary</code>). Add <code>role="presentation"</code> to the opening <code>&lt;table&gt;</code> tag for layout tables to prevent screen readers from announcing the tables.</p>
        <p>Note: Unless the targeted user agents cannot support the desired layout in CSS, new content should not use tables for layout as they are not semantically correct. However, because layout tables were used so extensively, current assistive technology has been adapted for them. So, legacy content may use layout tables without significantly degrading the experience for users with disabilities. (As layout tables disappear from the Web, future assistive technologies  may not handle layout tables well.)</p>

        <h4>JavaScript</h4>
        <ol class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--ordered">
          <li>When adding content using JS, include correct semantic mark-up.</li>
          <li>When adding content to the Document Object Model, use nodes that describe the content semantically:
<pre><code>
function addNews() {   
  /* create a heading */
  var myH = document.createElement("h3");

  /* create a text node */
  var myHT = document.createTextNode("Author is Online");

  /* place text node into the heading element */
  myH.appendChild(myHT);

  /* place heading element on the page */
  document.body.appendChild(myH);

  /* do the same for a paragraph of text */
  var myP = document.createElement("p");
  var myPT = document.createTextNode("To chat with ...");
  myP.appendChild(myPT);
  document.body.appendChild(myP);
}</code></pre>
          </li>
        </ol>
 
        <h3>Android Applications</h3>
        <p>User interface elements should be used in accordance with their intended purpose.  Wherever possible use standard UI elements as these will automatically convey the element role.</p>
        <p><mark>Note: Android 5.0 and below does not currently provide semantic markup for headings.</mark></p>

        <h3>iOS Applications</h3>
        <p>User interface elements should be used in accordance with their intended purpose.  Wherever possible use standard UI elements as these will be automatically updated when the iOS changes and they contain the framework to make UI elements fully accessible.</p>
        <p>The <code>UIAccessibility</code> informal protocol provides information about the type of user interface control. The <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/objectivec/nsobject/1615202-accessibilitytraits">accessibilityTraits property</a> is used to define the element semantics. An element on the page can have more than one trait. The following traits can be used:</p>
        <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
          <li><code>UIAccessibilityTraitButton</code> - button element</li>
          <li><code>UIAccessibilityTraitLink</code> - link</li>
          <li><code>UIAccessibilityTraitSearchField</code> - search field</li>
          <li><code>UIAccessibilityTraitImage</code> - image</li>
          <li><code>UIAccessibilityTraitStaticText</code> - element is treated as static text and cannot be changed</li>
          <li><code>UIAccessibilityTraitHeader</code> - heading</li>
        </ul> 

        <h3>PDF in Acrobat</h3>
        <p>Acrobat supports creating tags for any content within your PDF without changing the visual appearance of the PDF. The tools to use for this are the TouchUp Reading Order Tool (TURO) and the Tags Panel. The location of the Tags Panel and TURO will vary depending on your version of Acrobat. <mark>In Acrobat 9 Pro, for example, you can find the Tags Panel at View &gt; Navigation Panels &gt; Tags and TURO is at Advanced &gt; Accessibility &gt; TouchUp Reading Order or Alt + AAT. In version X they are under the Tools menu.</mark></p>
        <p>If the document is simple and the tags do not already exist in the PDF, it is easiest to begin with Acrobat's automatic tagging (Advanced &gt; Accessibility &gt; Add tags to document) and then manually adjust any tags that are not semantically correct. For more complex pages use Acrobat's Tags Panel or TURO to add tags.</p>

        <p>Semantic markup is created using tags. In order for your document to be correctly interpreted by assistive devices, the correct tags need to be defined.</p>
        <p>The common PDF tags include:</p>
        <table class="pe-table">
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th scope="col">Tag Type</th>
              <th scope="col">Purpose</th>
              <th scope="col">Tag Name</th>
              <th scope="col">Tag Tree Icon</th>
            </tr>

        </table>
        <p>Sometimes tags will appear in the tags tree that are different than the defined standard tag names used by Adobe Acrobat. These are defined by the authoring software tool. For example, Microsoft Word often uses the tag Normal instead of &lt;P&gt; for paragraphs.</p>
        <p><strong>Role mapping</strong> is a function that is mainly used with authoring software tools to map these non-standard tags to the standard Adobe Acrobat tags. If the tag is mapped to a standard tag name then you do not need to change the tag names in the tags tree.</p>
        <p>To view the list of role map items by selecting Edit Role Map in the Tags navigation panel options. If any of the role mappings are incorrect, edit the item. If a tag does not appear in this list, you can manually add it using the functions in this window.<br>
        <img src="images/role-map.jpg" width="328" height="369" alt=""></p>

        <h4>Headings</h4>

        <h5>Document Title</h5>
        <p>The main document title should be labeled using the tag. Typically this is shown on the cover or the first page of the document. This tag should only be used once in the document.</p>

        <h5>Section Headings</h5>
        <p>When a document includes section headings, those headings should be defined as heading tags. Adobe Acrobat provides 6 levels of headings which can be used define the hierarchy of headings and sub-headings in the document.</p>

        <h5>Image Section Headings</h5>
        <p>If an image is the heading for the section, tag the image as a heading. Add a new tag for the heading at the appropriate level and then add the &lt;Figure&gt; tag as a child of the heading tag.</p>
        
        <h4>Lists</h4>
        <p>If the document uses a list, the list should be marked up using list tags (&lt;L&gt; and &lt;LI&gt;). The &lt;LI&gt; tags should be grouped as children of a list (&lt;L&gt;) tag.<br>
          <img src="images/simple-list.jpg" width="264" height="248" alt="Common list structure is L tag with children LI tags. Typically under the LI tag is either the content, P tag with content or LBody tag."></p>

        <h5>Tip:</h5>
        <p>Sometimes you may see &lt;LBody&gt; present in the tags tree. This tag is not used by screen readers and is not necessary. If they are present, they can be kept but there is no need to manually add them.</p>

        <h5>Unordered Lists</h5>
        <p>Unordered lists will often include the bullet character within the list item &lt;LI&gt; tag. To tell screen readers to ignore this character, select the bullet and change it to background content using TURO. This will artifact the tag and it will no longer show up in the tags tree.</p>

        <h5>Ordered Lists</h5>
        <p>Ordered lists are defined in the same way as unordered lists. However, the numbers within the list text needs to be part of the &lt;LI&gt; tag and should not be set to background text.<br>
          <img src="images/ordered-list.jpg" width="270" height="213" alt=""></p>

        <h5>Nested Lists</h5>
        <p>To nest lists, add the &lt;L&gt; tag as a child to the &lt;LI&gt; of the parent list. The structure could look something like this:<br>
          <img src="images/list-structure.jpg" width="266" height="256" alt="The &lt;L&gt; tag has 4 &lt;LI&gt;.  Under one of the &lt;LI&gt; is a sublist. The sublist &lt;L&gt; is a child of the &lt;LI&gt;"></p>

        <h4>Paragraphs</h4>
        <p>All text that is not a heading or cannot be tagged with another tag should be defined as a paragraph (&lt;P&gt;) tag. This includes introductory paragraphs, abstracts and text that are highlighted graphically.</p>
        <p>Sometimes paragraphs are defined using non-standard tag names. These may be mapped using the Role Mapping and would act like a paragraph. Check the role mapping before reassigning the tag as these may not need to be changed.</p>
        
        <h5>Content that spans multiple pages</h5>
        <p>If text straddles two or more pages, the text should be combined into a single paragraph tag. To combine two tags, select and expand each tag in the tags panel to show their text containers. Drag one to combine the two containers under one tag, and then delete the remaining, empty tag. The same situation can occur with lists, tables, and tables of content but they tend to be easier to identify because their parent tag repeats.</p>
        <p>Multiple tables are often caused intentionally by the content author. For screen reader users it is best to combine them into one table with one column header row.</p>

        <h4>Tables</h4>
        <img src="images/table-tag-structure.jpg" style="float:right;" width="137" height="276" alt="">
        <p>Tables need to be structured in a way that helps users who cannot see the screen understand the relationship of the data in the cells. The following table tags should be used:</p>
        <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
          <li>Table row (&lt;TR&gt;) to define each row of table cells</li>
          <li>Table headers (&lt;TH&gt;) for table header cells</li>
          <li>Table data (&lt;TD&gt;) for table data cells</li>
        </ul>

        <h5 style="clear:both;">Table Headers</h5>
        <p>Both row and column headers can be defined using the table header (&lt;TH&gt;) tag and scope to define whether or not a cell is a column or row header.</p>
        <p>The easiest way to set the scope of a header cell is using the table editor.<br>
          <img src="images/table-cell-properties.jpg" width="346" height="114" alt=""></p> 
        <p>In the properties, set the type to header cell and the scope to the appropriate value. The scope property can have the following values:</p>
        <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
          <li>Row – for row headers</li>
          <li>Column – for column headers</li>
          <li>Both – for cells that are both a row header and a column header</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If the table has complex headers and the scope attributes are not sufficient to associate header cells with data cells, you will need to use header IDs. This usually happens when you have a header cell that spans multiple columns and only applies to some of the cells below.</p>
        <p>To assign to headers and IDs to the table cells, first define the cell as a &lt;TH&gt; then give the header cell an ID. Make sure that the scope is set to NONE. Then for each data cell, assign the associate header cell IDs.<br>
          <img src="images/header-complex-properties.jpg" width="347" height="357" alt="In the table cell properties dialog, set the type radio button to header cell. The scope should be set to none. In the attribute section, type in a value in the ID textbox."></p>

        <h5>Screen Reader Tips:</h5>
        <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
          <li><mark>JAWS 12 will only read column header. Row headers are ignored. This is a bug in JAWS.</mark></li>
          <li>Screen readers read the header ids starting with the column header and then the row headers. The order displayed in the Associated Header Cells IDs list does not matter.</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>Spanning Cells</h5>
        <p>If a cell spans two or more rows or columns should use RowSpan and ColSpan attribute to define the number of rows or columns that the cell spans. The easiest way to do this is to use TURO and the Table Editor. In the cell context menu select Table Editor. This will show the table structure on the page. In the cell that spans multiple cells, right-click and select Table Cell Properties. In this dialog, set the row or column span to the number of cells spanned.</p>

        <h5>Blank Cells</h5>
        <p>If your table has blanks cells, these may not be automatically defined in the table tags. If there are blank cells that are present but there is no tag in the tags tree, add an empty &lt;TD&gt; tag so that the row or column has the same number of cells as the other rows.</p>
 
        <h3>Word</h3>
        <p>When formatting is used to convey special meaning to content, be sure to use the built-in Word styles and features as much as possible to maximize accessibility. For example, use styles for emphasized content, lists, tables, heading, headers, and footers. Conversely, when those styles and features are used, ensure that they are used to convey particular meaning or organization of content and not simply used because the visual appearance matches a desired look.</p>

        <h4>Headings</h4>
        <p>Define all headings using Word heading styles. Modify the Word heading styles to change the font, color and other style elements (see <a href="#g9">PG 9 In Page Navigation</a> for more information on headings).</p>
        <p>Avoid creating a new Word style for headings as this will not be defined as a heading even it is defined as style that is based on a heading.</p>
        <p>Word styles should not be misused or used just for visual appearance of the formatting.</p>

        <h4>Lists</h4>
        <p>The toolbar options in Home &gt; Paragraph for unordered (bullet) and ordered (numbered) lists automatically apply list styles. Other styles are available in the styles window for indented lists, and using indent or tab automatically applies them.</p>
        <p>Avoid using empty list items for spacing. Instead, apply paragraph spacing on individual lines as necessary. Do not simulate lists with direct formatting. Use Word styles.</p>

        <h4>Tables</h4>
        <p>Use Word built-in tables to present tabular content and data. Do not simulate tables with white space (adding spaces and tabs or using columns) or use draw table functions in Word as they will not provide the semantic table structure.</p>
        <p>In the table properties, set the following options:<br>
          <img src="images/table-properties.jpg" width="433" height="238" alt=""></p>
        <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
          <li>Allow row to break across pages should not be checked</li>
          <li>If the table has column headers, select the top row and set check the heading row should repeat across pages checkbox</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Avoid empty table rows and splitting content into multiple tables as this will make the table harder to understand.</p>
        <p>Note: There is no way to explicitly set row and column headers in Word.</p>
  
        <h4>Paragraphs</h4>
        <p>Use paragraph spacing for layout rather than adding extra blank paragraphs. Think of Word paragraphs as containers of content, not as the return key on a typewriter. All paragraph containers should have content otherwise JAWS will announce them as blank.</p>

        <h4>Drop Caps</h4>
        <p>Do not use Word's drop caps feature. The letters are set up as text boxes, which are not read by screen readers.</p>

        <h4>Header / Footer</h4>
        <p>Use the Word built-in feature rather than simulating them. They are not read by screen readers so make sure that any important information is also included once in the overall document content.</p>

        <h4>Styles</h4>
        <p>Choose styles over direct formatting as much as possible. Though the use of character styles such as emphasis and strong is encouraged for ease of document consistency and maintenance, at this time screen readers do not announce them.</p>
        <p>However, consider incorporating character styles in your approach anyway for the benefit for document maintenance. As a general best practice, avoid creating many variations of styles when a small set will work. Name the styles for the content that they represent and how they should be used rather than for their appearance, e.g. "Term definition" rather than "bold 15 before 10 after". This will simplify the conversion to PDF.</p>

        <h3>PowerPoint</h3>
        <p>Use the built-in PowerPoint elements. For example, use the numbered and bulleted list options on the Home tab, and use Title containers. Empty content such as lists and paragraphs can confuse screen reader users when they navigate by paragraphs or when lists are announced with the wrong number of elements. Fragmented content can also be confusing when it is spoken. Look for situations where lines are broken up to wrap around objects. Overall, try to use the appropriate content layout, indentation, and paragraph spacing for visual alignment, rather than tabs, paragraphs, and spaces.</p>
        
        <h4>Special Content</h4>
        <p>Some special content is not accessible in PowerPoint. Embedded Excel charts and tables, and Word documents are visible and accessible in edit mode, e.g. the "normal presentation view". Users can navigate to the object and interact with it. However, in slideshow mode, they cannot interact with the object to view data, text, or graph elements. Excel data pasted "as HTML" can be accessible. Consider replacing Word content and Excel data with normal PowerPoint content holders, tables with PowerPoint tables, and graphs with PowerPoint graphs or screenshot pictures.</p>

        <h4>Multimedia</h4>
        <p>Audio, video, and Flash movies should contain captions, textual descriptions, or spoken descriptions as appropriate. </p>
        <p><mark>Note: PowerPoint 2010 includes a new tool, Sub-titling Text Add-in for Microsoft PowerPoint (STAMP) that allows you to add captions to video and audio, or import Timed Text Markup caption files from within PowerPoint.</mark></p>
        <p>Interactive Flash content can be difficult to make accessible. Be sure to test it using a screen reader to make sure that you can tab to the control to activate it, interact with it using the keyboard, and hear the appropriate content from the screen reader.</p>

        <h3>Excel</h3>
        <p>Microsoft Excel has a built-in function that can be used to give names to a cell or a range of cells. Screen readers look for certain specific names to identify which cells contain row and column titles.</p>
        <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
          <li>To create both row and column headers, move to the intersection of the row and column titles and add the name to the cell using the "Define Name" option in the context menu (right click or shift+F10). Set the name to Title (one word with mixed case).</li>
          <li>To create just row headers, navigate to the column containing the titles and open the Define Name dialog box. Set the name to RowTitle (one word with mixed case and no spaces).</li>
          <li>To create just column headers, navigate to the column containing the titles and open the Define Name dialog box. Set the name to ColumnTitle (one word with mixed case and no spaces).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>NOTE: These procedures can also be used when column titles span multiple rows or when row titles span multiple columns.

More complex data tables may have many cells that need clarification of their scope using the scope tag. Data tables can also be marked up with <code>headers</code>/<code>id</code> combinations, where every header cell has an <code>id</code> and every data cell has a <code>headers</code> attribute listing (space delimited) the <code>id</code>s of its header cells.</p>

      <h2 id="g12">Guideline 12. Don't provide info only through text formatting</h2>
      <div class="guideline_content">
        <p class="summary">When text formatting (e.g. italic, underline, bold, font size) is used to provide information that goes beyond emphasis, also provide the information through an additional method.</p>
          
        <h3>Rationale</h3>
        <p>Media content will be transformed into:</p>
        <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
          <li>Spoken words</li>
          <li>Braille</li>
          <li>Large text</li>
          <li>Custom color schemes</li>
          <li>Custom layouts</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Text formatting can be lost in the transformation.</p>
        <p>Even when the information about text formatting is not entirely lost, it can become less noticeable or time-consuming to access. For example, when screen readers recognize a particular type of text-formatting, they handle it in one of two ways:</p>
        <ol class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--ordered">
          <li>Provide the information only if the screen reader user requests information on the formatting of the particular word</li>
          <li>Read it differently (e.g. louder, slower, different pitch) than surrounding text</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The former (1) makes finding particular words that have special formatting very time-consuming.</p>
        <p>The latter (2) is rare in screen readers today, even for semantic formatting such as HTML's <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;em&gt;</code> tags. </p>
        <p>Features that convey which text is emphasized are the responsibility of the assistive technology (e.g. screen reader, custom style sheet). Content developers cannot effectively add text that indicates which text is emphasized. This would make the experience worse for all users, including screen reader users. When formatting provides emphasis, content developers should simply use formatting that allows assistive technologies to provide the information as appropriate for their users (see <a href="#g11">PG 11</a>).</p>
        <p>However, if we extend the purpose of text formatting, using it to provide more information than simple emphasis, it is our responsibility to also provide the information through another method. For example, a paragraph of text might be followed by the instructions, "Explain the significance of the three bold words in the paragraph." In this case, we need to list the three words and, if the paragraph is very long, provide links back to the words in paragraph. This way, students who are using screen readers or custom formatting will be able to find the three words.</p>

        <h3>Techniques</h3>
        <h4>Discussing/Identifying Particular Words and Phrases</h4>
        <p>If text formatting is used to identify particular words or phrases (beyond just emphasizing the words or phrases) provide another way to find the words or phrases, such as:</p>
        <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
          <li>Quoting the text or the word. For example, "Select the best definition for the word 'like' as it is used in the paragraph."</li>
          <li>Providing a link to the text or the word.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Providing Data</h4>
        <p>If text formatting is used to provide data, also provide the data in another way, such as:</p>
        <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
          <li>Including the information as text. For example, if required lessons are in bold and optional lessons are in regular text, you could mark each required lesson with the word "required", or you could make each optional lesson with the word "optional". Another option is to mark one type of lesson with an * and then define the meaning of the * somewhere obvious on the page.</li>
          <li>Using reading order to make it easy to see relationships. For example, if the size of the name of a town is used to show the relative size of the area's population, include the population as text and also make sure the reading order (See <a href="#g4">Guideline 4</a>) is lowest to highest or highest to lowest. This way, just as a sighted user might skim the names and read largest to smallest based on text size, a blind screen reader user can do the same rather than having to read each town name and remember the numbers.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Marking up Text</h4>
        <p>If text formatting is used to illustrate the state of particular text, also provide this information in another way, such as:</p>
        <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
          <li>Use hidden text for screen reader users, so that some short phrase appears before and after the text. For example, if text has been highlighted by the instructor, hidden text can be added: "begin instructor highlight" and "end instructor highlight". See code clips for how to do this with CSS.</li>
          <li>Provide an additional view of the information. For example, if various differences in text are used to show three different revisions of a paragraph, many users will benefit from the ability to also read each version side-by-side in a table, divided into rows so as to highlight the changes.</li>
        </ul>

      <h2 id="g13">Guideline 13. Use same info without style sheets (Same Info without Style Sheets)</h2>
      <div class="guideline_content">
        <p class="summary">Do not use presentation layers (e.g. css, styles) to provide information unless the information is also presented through content or through semantic markup. (And do not use presentation layers to hide content that would be disruptive or misleading if shown.)</p>
        
        <h3>Rationale</h3>
        <p>Screen readers usually do not read information from the presentation layer. So, screen reader users would generally miss any information provided in the presentation layer alone.</p>
        <p>Also, when technologies provide separate layers for content and presentation, users are generally allowed to remove or replace the presentation layer. Users with low vision or learning disabilities may replace the visual presentation in favor of a custom visual presentation style that works better for them. As such, any information that is conveyed only through the presentation layer will be lost for these users as well.</p>
        <p>In many cases it is okay to hide information using presentation layers. For example, the HTML techiques in these guidelines occasionally recommend placing information offscreen using CSS to provide extra information for screen reader users. Also, it is acceptable to hide elements in an expanding/collapsing menu using CSS, if the menu appears fully expanded when CSS is off or replaced.</p>
        <p>However, if you were to hide and show an error message, such as "The server is offline!" using a CSS setting, users who turn off or replace CSS would always see that message. Thus, the information on the page relies on CSS and is inaccurate if the CSS is not present. This type of situation can be as bad or worse than having information missing when the CSS is not present.</p>
      
        <h3>Technology Specifics</h3>
        <h4>HTML | XHTML | CSS</h4>
        <p>Do not use CSS to introduce information that is not available through another method. Examples of this problem include:</p>
        <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
          <li>Information conveyed through CSS background images (There is no way to include alt-text for these images in the CSS. Also, the images will be lost if the style sheet is replaced.)</li>
          <li>Information conveyed through text added through CSS, such as pseudo-elements <code>:before</code> and <code>:after</code>. (Browsers do not pass this information to screen readers and information will be lost if the style sheet is replaced.)
            <pre><code>
/* Do NOT use unless "100% Correct" is also conveyed elsewhere */
h1.congratulations:before {
  content: "100% Correct: ";
}</code></pre>
          </li>
          <li><p>Information conveyed by using CSS to establish categories:</p>
            <pre><code>
/* Do NOT use unless the time period associated with each piece of content
   is also conveyed through text */
div.paleozoic {
  border-style: dashed;
}
div.mesozoic {
  border-style: solid;
}
div.cenozoic {
  border-style: dotted;
}</code></pre>
            <p>(Again, screen readers will not convey this information &amp; it will also be lost if the style sheet is replaced.)</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4>JavaScript</h4>
        <p>If your Web application hides and shows content, that functionality may be required for access to the information on the page, so, either:</p>
        <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
          <li><p>(Preferred) Use server-side technology so that you don't have to add the content to the page until it is needed.</p>
            <p>OR</p>
          </li>
          <li><p>(Preferred) Keep CSS and JavaScript behavior separate. Hide or show content by removing or adding DOM nodes instead of adjusting CSS styles. This way, people who use custom style sheets can still benefit from the JavaScript behavior.</p>
            <pre><code>function hide() {
  window.myparent = document.getElementById("a1");
  window.myobj = document.getElementById("b2");
  window.myparent.removeChild(window.myobj);
}
function show() {
  window.myparent.appendChild(window.myobj);
}</code></pre>
            <pre><code>
&lt;a href="javascript:hide();"&gt;Hide sentence below &lt;/a&gt;
|
&lt;a href="javascript:show();"&gt;Show sentence below &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div id="a1"&gt;
  &lt;p id="b2"&gt;Sentence to hide or show goes here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>
            <p>JavaScript Only Hide/Show Sample Page: <mark><a href="DOM_Hide_Show_Nodes.html">This Window</a> | <a target="_blank" href="DOM_Hide_Show_Nodes.html">New Window</a></mark></p>
            <p>For an additional example, see <a href="#g33">PG 33</a>.</p>
          </li>
          <li>Make sure all content is displayed and makes sense when CSS is not available. For example, a menu that can expand and collapse, might appear fully expanded when the Web page's CSS are not used.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>PowerPoint</h3>
        <p>Avoid placing content in the slide master. The information contained in the slide master is not read by screen readers.</p>

      <h2 id="g14">Guideline 14. Associate every form element with a label (Form Field Labels)</h2>
      <div class="guideline_content">
        <p class="summary">Tie each user input control (e.g. text field, radio button, pull-down menu) to text that describes the purpose of the control, using conventions for the media type.</p>
          
        <h3>Rationale</h3>
        <p>When a form field lacks an explicit label, screen readers will try to figure out which onscreen text labels the field. Sometimes they can’t find any appropriate text, in which case the screen reader speaks no label at all. And, sometimes, the screen reader guesses the wrong label.</p>
        <p>The techniques for this guideline explain how to use markup and other technology features to explicitly associate text labels with corresponding form elements in a way that screen readers will recognize. Explicit labels ensure that screen reader users will understand which form elements are associated with which labels. This way, they can be confident that they are entering information using the correct form fields.<br>
        <img alt="A mouse cursor points at the label of a radio button and the button is highlighted in response." width="190" height="100" src="images/laws.png"></p>
        <p>Also, in HTML and Flex, many browsers use explicit labels to give users easier mouse access to radio buttons and check boxes. Clicking anywhere on the label can select and de-select the form elements. This is particularly helpful for people with minor mobility or dexterity issues.</p>

        <h3>HTML &amp; JavaScript</h3>
        <h4>Quick Look!</h4>
        <p>Usually use: <code>&lt;label for="my_id"&gt;My Label&lt;/label&gt; &lt;input type="text" id="my_id"&gt;</code></p>
        <p>If there is no onscreen text use: <code>title="My Label"</code></p>
        <p>If the onscreen text is in two places, use: <code>aria-labelledby="my_id1 myid_2"</code></p>
          
        <h4>Forms Fields with Text Labels</h4>
        <p>When form elements (e.g. checkboxes, radio buttons, select menus, text fields, and text areas) have onscreen text that tells the user the purpose of the form element, give the form field an id attribute. Then wrap the prompting information with the <code>&lt;label&gt;</code> tag. The value of the for attribute of the <code>&lt;label&gt;</code> tag should match the value of the <code>id</code> attribute of the form control.<br>
          <img alt="A physics question of about 35 words serves as the label for a text field." width="431" height="79" src="images/physics.png"></p>
        <pre><code>
&lt;label for="q4"&gt;A ball is moving in a vertical circle with a
  radius of 0.76 meters. Its speed is 5.3 m/s at the top. To the
  nearest tenth of a m/s2, what is its acceleration at the top?&lt;/label&gt;
&lt;input type="text" id="q4"&gt;</code></pre>

        <h4>Form Fields Labeled by an Image </h4> 
        <p>If an image is used as the onscreen label, the image tag (with alt-text) should be associated with the form element using the <code>&lt;label&gt;</code> tag:<br>
        <img alt="An image of text is used to label a text field as site search." width="214" height="23" src="images/search.png"></p>
        <pre><code>
&lt;label for="search"&gt;
  &lt;img scr="search.gif" alt="Site Search:"&gt;
&lt;/label&gt;
&lt;input type="text" id="search"&gt;</code></pre>
          
        <h4>Form Fields without Onscreen Labels</h4>
        <p>When form elements (e.g. text fields, select menus, and text areas) do not have onscreen text that tells the user the purpose of the form element, or if that prompting information is coming from more than one place, a title attribute that provides this information should be added to the form element.<br>
        <img alt="A text field followed by a 'Find it!' button has no onscreen label." width="196" height="24" src="images/go.png"></p>
        <pre><code>&lt;input type="text" title="Search Terms" /&gt;</code></pre>
        <p><img alt="Phone number entry is broken into three separate text fields, with just one onscreen label, 'Phone Number' " width="250" height="30" src="images/phone.png"></p>
        <pre><code>Phone Number:
&lt;input type="text" name="areacode" size="3" title="Phone Number Area Code"&gt;
&lt;input type="text" name="three" size="3" title="Phone Number Three Digits"&gt;
&lt;input type="text" name="four" size="4" title="Phone Number Last Four Digits"&gt;</code></pre>

        <h4>Form Fields with Two or more Onscreen Labels</h4>
        <p>Sometimes form elements (e.g. text fields, select menus, and text areas) are labeled by two or more bits of text that are separated by other HTML elements. While two or more <code>label for="my_id"</code> elements, each referencing the same id, are supposed to work for this, this is not reliable. The new WAI-ARIA attribute <code>aria-labelledby</code>, however, allows you to use a list of space-separated ids as the value. This is the best supported technique to use today, as of December 2013.</p>
        <pre><code>
&lt;label id="c1"&gt;Credit Card:&lt;/label&gt;
&lt;input type="text" aria-labelledby="c1 c2" /&gt;
&lt;label id="c2"&gt;(Visa, Discover, or Master Card)&lt;/label&gt;</code></pre>
        <p>Screen readers will read the labels in the order that their ids are listed in the <code>aria-labelledby</code> attribute.</p>
        
        <h4>Labels for Groups of Form Fields</h4>
        <p>If your radio buttons or checkboxes need a group label to be understood, use fieldset and legend tags to associate the group label with the form fields:<br>
        <img alt="Radio buttons labeled 'Yes' and 'No' under the text 'Is this a gift?' " width="117" height="90" src="images/isthisagift.png"></p>
        <pre><code>
&lt;fieldset&gt;
  &lt;legend&gt;Is this a gift?&lt;/legend&gt;
  &lt;input type="radio" id="y" /&gt; &lt;label for="y"&gt;Yes&lt;/label&gt;
  &lt;input type="radio" id="n" /&gt; &lt;label for="n"&gt;No&lt;/label&gt;
&lt;/fieldset&gt;</code></pre>
        <p>Screen readers will present the legend when the user tabs to the group of form fields. </p>
        
        <h4>Long Labels for Groups of Form Fields as Occur in Quizzes</h4>
        <p>Some screen readers will read the legend with each form control. If the group label is too long (over 25 words) to be heard with each form field, mark the group label as a heading.</p>
        <p>In quizzes, pay attention to consistency. If some questions in a quiz are so long that they need to use headings instead of legends, then all of the questions should use headings instead of legends.<br>
        <img alt="The question text for two physics multiple choice questions are marked as headings and each radio button has label markup. One of the questions is longer than 25 words." width="487" height="504" src="images/practice_questions.png"></p>
        
        <h4>JavaScript for Creating Form Fields with Labels</h4>
        <p>Include labels or titles, as appropriate, when using the DOM to create new form fields. For example:</p>
        
        <pre><code>
/* create a radio button with id */
var myNewRadio = document.createElement("input");
myNewRadio.type = "radio";
myNewRadio.id = "blue";

/* create a label element with for attribute */
var myNewLabel = document.createElement("label");
myNewLabel.htmlFor = "blue";

/* create a text node */
var myLabelText = document.createTextNode(" Blue Car");

/* place text node into the label element */
myNewLabel.appendChild(myLabelText);

/* place radio element on the page */
document.body.appendChild(myNewRadio);

/* place label element on the page */
document.body.appendChild(myNewLabel);</code></pre>

        <h4>Screen Reader Behaviour Tips</h4>
        <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
          <li><p>When using the <code>label</code> element, always use the <code>for</code> attribute as described above. <mark>Simply enclosing the form field and the text label in the <code>label</code> element does not work in popular screen readers today.</mark><ins>It works in all screen readers today but still fails Dragon NaturallySpeaking 13</ins></p>
          <pre><code>
&lt;!-- Do Not Use This Code --&gt;
&lt;label&gt;Please enter your name  &lt;input type="text" id="name"&gt; &lt;/label&gt;</code></pre>
          </li>
          <li>We recommend avoiding using both a <code>label</code> element and a <code>title</code> attribute for the same form element, as that can complicate interaction with the form for screen reader users.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>HTML Validation Tips</h4>
        <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
          <li>The value of HTML id attributes must be unique through out each document.</li>
          <li>The value of HTML id attributes should not begin with a number.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Android Applications</h3>
        <p>All form controls must have a label defined. The method used to define the label for the form field depends on the type of form control.</p>
        <p>Label and instruction text MUST be programmatically associated with the input.</p>
        <h4>Text Inputs</h4>
        <p>Text inputs must have a visible label connected as the accessible name of the EditText input via the android:labelFor property ID value association.
        <p><code>EditText</code> inputs should not use an <code>android:hint</code> attribute as the only visible label because when the field is filled, TalkBack reads the entered value to the user instead of the hint text and visually the placeholder text will disappear preventing the user from seeing the label name.</li>
        <h5>Code Example Using android:labelFor ID Connections</h5>
        <pre><code>    &lt;TextView
        android:id="@+id/textView"
        android:labelFor="@+id/editText2"
        android:text="First Name"/>

    &lt;EditText
        android:id="@+id/editText2"
        android:hint="John"
        android:inputType="textPersonName" /></code></pre>
        <h4>Checkboxes, RadioButtons, Switch Controls</h4>
        <p>Controls that already have visible text included like Checkboxes, RadioButtons, Switch Controls, etc. MUST use android:text as the connected label that is spoken to TalkBack users on focus.
        <p>Native controls that don't include visible android:text properties, e.g. SeekBar sliders, will have to use android:labelFor method to connect label text as their accessible name. 
        <h5>Code Example Using android:text as Label</h5>
        <pre><code>&lt;CheckBox
        android:id="@+id/checkBox2"
        android:text="I Agree to Terms & Conditions" />
&lt;Switch
        android:id="@+id/switch3"
        android:text="Remember Username"/>
        </code></pre>
        <h4>Grouping Form Inputs</h4>
        <h5>Code Example Using android:contentDescription to Add Legend Text</h5>
        <pre><code>    &lt;TextView
        android:id="@+id/textView4"
        android:textColor="#000"
        android:text="Preferred Contact Method(s)" />

    &lt;CheckBox
        android:text="Phone"
        android:contentDescription="Phone, Preferred Contact Method(s)"
        android:id="@+id/checkBox8" />

    &lt;CheckBox
        android:text="Email"
        android:contentDescription="Email, Preferred Contact Method(s)"
        android:id="@+id/checkBox9" />

    &lt;CheckBox
        android:text="SMS"
        android:contentDescription="SMS, Preferred Contact Method(s)"
        android:id="@+id/checkBox10" />
        </code></pre>
       

        <h3>iOS Applications</h3>
        <h4>Labels MUST Be Visible and Programmatically Associated to Inputs</h4>
        <p>All form controls MUST have explicit and visible labels. The label is defined using the <code>accessibilityLabel</code> property to name the form control. If there are instructions, examples or other related information for the form field, this can be associated to the form field using the <code>accessibilityHint</code> property.</p>
        <h5>Code Example Setting TextField .accessibilityLabel Property to Match the Visible UILabel Text</h5>
        <pre><code>emailTextField.accessibilityLabel = emailLabel.text</code></pre>
        <h4>Input Groups MUST Have a Group Label Programmatically Defined</h4>
        <h5>Code Example Setting Custom Radio Button Controls .accessibilityLabel Property to Include the Visible Group Legend Text</h5>
        <pre><code>radio5.accessibilityLabel = radio5.accessibilityLabel! + ", " + legend.accessibilityLabel!
radio6.accessibilityLabel = radio6.accessibilityLabel! + ", " + legend.accessibilityLabel!
radio7.accessibilityLabel = radio7.accessibilityLabel! + ", " + legend.accessibilityLabel!
radio8.accessibilityLabel = radio8.accessibilityLabel! + ", " + legend.accessibilityLabel!</code></pre>


        <h3>PDF in Acrobat</h3>
        <p>Form fields within the PDF document allow people with visual impairments easier access to enter data. If there are form fields within the PDF document, Acrobat will display a prompt to highlight them.</p>
        <p>If there are no form fields in the document, there is nothing further that needs to be done. </p>
        
        <h4>Interactive Form Fields</h4>
        <p>Creating accessible form fields to a PDF is a multi-step process.</p>
        <p>The process is slightly different in each version of Acrobat. In Acrobat 9 Pro, do the following:</p>
        <ol class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--ordered"> 
          <li>If there are no form fields in the document, use Advanced &gt; Accessibility &gt; Run Form Field Recognition to automatically detect form fields and to make them fillable. Using the form editor, add and edit fields as necessary.</li>
          <li>For each form field in the document, edit the properties using the context menu for the form field and select Properties. Each form field needs an accessible name using the tooltip property.
              <img alt="" width="361" height="298" src="images/PDF-form-field-properties.jpg">
          </li>
          <li>Add the form fields to the tags tree at Advanced &gt; Accessibility &gt; Add Form Fields to Tags</li>
          <li>Run the Full Accessibility Check at Advanced &gt; Accessibility &gt; Full Check… This will uncover any form fields that were not automatically added to the tags tree.</li>
          <li>For the form fields that were not added, use the TouchUp Reading Order tool to tag the fields as a form field.</li>
          <li>Check the order of the tags. The text prompt should be either before or after the form field based on the visual position on the page.</li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Required Indicator</h4>
        <p>The required indicator is set using the form field properties. Access the context menu for the form field and select the Properties dialog. Check the Required checkbox. This will require a user to fill in the selected form field and will present an error message to the user if they do not fill it the field.</p>
        
        <h4>Submit Buttons</h4>
        <p>Creating a submit button is similar to adding new form fields.</p>
        <p>To create a button in <mark>Acrobat 9 Pro</mark>, select Forms &gt; Form Tools &gt; Button from the toolbar and place the button on the page. Next, set the button properties by selecting Properties… from the context menu. Provide the name and a tooltip for the button. In the options tab, select a layout and add the text Submit in the label field to identify the button as a submit button. As the final step, go to the Actions tab and set the Select Trigger to Mouse Up which is keyboard accessible. To define the action to take, select the Add… button and select the appropriate action.</p>

        <h3><mark>Flash</mark></h3>
        <h4>CheckBoxes and RadioButtons</h4>
        <p>The simplest way to label Flash CheckBoxes and RadioButtons is to use the native Flash components and use the label parameter to add the onscreen labels. The label parameter can be set through the Component Inspector or through ActionScript. See <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2010/NOTE-WCAG20-TECHS-20101014/FLASH29" target="_blank">WCAG 2.0 Technique Flash 29 (opens in new window)</a> for code samples.</p>
        <p>To make fully accessible checkBoxes and radioButtons, see also <a href="#g20">Pearson Guideline 20</a>, which discusses ensuring that screen reader users will know that these are radioButtons and checkBoxes and what their state is (e.g. checked or unchecked).</p>

        <h3><mark>Flex</mark></h3>
        <h4>TextInputs, TextAreas and Combo Boxes</h4>
        <img alt="" width="284" height="122" src="images/flex_TextArea_TextInput.png">
        <p>Place your TextInput or TextArea component into a <code>FormItem</code>, which can be assigned a label in Design Mode, in the Properties panel, or in the MXML as shown below. This will be set up for you automatically if you drag a "Form" component onto the stage in design mode and then drag a TextInput or TextArea into that "Form" component.</p>
        
        <pre><code>&lt;mx:FormItem label="Your Name:" fontWeight="bold"&gt;
&lt;mx:TextInput/&gt;
&lt;/mx:FormItem&gt;
&lt;mx:FormItem label="Your Comments:" fontWeight="bold"&gt;
&lt;mx:TextArea height="84"/&gt; &lt;/mx:FormItem&gt;</code></pre>
        <p>Note that this does not work ideally for Combo Boxes in FlashPlayer currently. When you tab to the ComboBox, you do not hear the label. This is a bug. However, if you use reading commands, the text is read just before the form control. The same issue occurs if you set the Accessible Name directly in Action Script, or if you use a <code>toolTip</code>. However, in these cases the onscreen text and the accessible name are each read, which creates unnecessary noise. So, we see the method recommended above as the best option.</p>
        
        <h4>CheckBoxes and RadioButtons</h4>
        <img alt="The Flex Properties window for a CheckBox has a label field under the 'Common' heading." width="292" height="215" src="images/flex_properties_label.png">
        <p>The simplest way to label Flex CheckBoxes and RadioButtons is to use the native Flex components and use the label property to add the onscreen labels. Labels can be set in design mode or in the properties panel. Or they can be added as attributes in the Flex MXML source code:</p>
        <pre><code>&lt;mx:CheckBox label="Red" id="myRedCheckBox" /&gt;</code></pre>
        <p>Like any MXML attribute, labels can also be updated or created dynamically, using ActionScript:</p>
        <pre><code>myRedCheckBox.label="Yellow";</code></pre>

        <h4>Labels for Groups of RadioButtons or CheckBoxes</h4>
        <img alt="Radio buttons labeled 'Yes' and 'No' under the text 'Is this a gift?'" width="158" height="61" src="images/fieldsetFlex.png">
        <p>If your RadioButtons or CheckBoxes need a group label to be understood, use FormItem to group the buttons and provide a group label. This will be set up for you automatically if you drag a form component onto the stage in design mode, and then drag RadioButtons or CheckBoxes into that form component. It can also be set up in MXML as shown below:</p>
        <pre><code>&lt;mx:Form x="50" y="296" width="484" height="202"&gt;
&lt;mx:FormItem label="Is this a gift?" fontWeight="bold"&gt;
  &lt;mx:RadioButton label="Yes"/&gt;
  &lt;mx:RadioButton label="No"/&gt;
&lt;/mx:FormItem&gt;
&lt;/mx:Form&gt;</code></pre>

        <h4>Long Labels for Groups of RadioButtons or CheckBoxes as Occur in Quizzes</h4>
        <p>Some screen readers will read the <code>FormItem</code> label with each form control. If the group label is too long (over 25 words) to be heard with each form field, make the group label tabEnabled, when there is a screen reader present. </p>
        
        <h3>CODE HERE.</h3>
        <p>In quizzes, pay attention to consistency. If some questions in a quiz are so long that they need to use tabEnabled questions instead of <code>FormItem</code>s, then all of the questions should.</p>
        
        <h4>Form Fields without On-screen Labels</h4>
        <img alt="A pulldown menu has no on-screen text, but is followed by a 'Go' button.' A toolTip over the pulldown menu reads 'Go to Chapter.'" width="234" height="153" src="images/flex_form_wo_onscreen_label.png">
        <p>When form elements do not have on-screen text that tells the user the purpose of the form element, or if that prompting information is coming from more than one place, use a <code>toolTip</code> attribute to label the form element. This not only provides a tooltip, but also sets an accessible name for the form control. This name is then used as the label for the form field in screen readers. (You can also set the accessible name directly, see 'Alternative Solution' below.)</p>
        <p>Tooltips can be provided through Action Script, or can simply be written into the MXML:</p>
        <pre><code>
&lt;mx:ComboBox x="240" y="107" toolTip="Go to Chapter" dataProvider="{myPages}" width="160"&gt;&lt;/mx:ComboBox&gt;</code></pre>

        <h4>Alternative Solution for any Type of Form Field: set an Accessible Name</h4>
        <p>If the solutions above are not well-suited for your particular case, setting the accessible name through Action Script is another option:</p>
        <pre><code>&lt;mx:TextInput x="10" y="499"
creationComplete="event.target.accessibilityProperties=new AccessibilityProperties();
event.target.accessibilityProperties.name='Your Name'" /&gt;</code></pre>  
        <p>If an accessible name has not be set and a toolTip has been set, the toolTip will be used as the accessible name.</p>

              <td><p>If the on-screen prompting text is contiguous (so that entire label can be inside one HTML tag) and if it adequately indicates the purpose of the control, then the <code>label</code> element should be used to wrap that text. That <code>label</code> tag should have a <code>for</code> attribute which is identical to the <code>id</code> of the control. (Note: <code>id</code>s must be unique.)</p>
                  <p>If that on-screen text is not adequate or if it is dispersed (coming from more than one place), then the <code>title</code> attribute should be used on the <code>input</code> element and should indicate the purpose of the control.</p>
                  <p>There may be a situation where dispersed labeling information will not cause the form to need a <code>title</code>. This occurs when the form controls are wrapped inside a <code>fieldset</code> that has a <code>legend</code>. This is typically a question followed by a set of radio buttons or checkboxes. If the <code>fieldset</code> wraps the combination, the <code>legend</code> is the "question" and each control (radio button or checkbox) has an adequate <code>label</code>, then that set of controls is properly labeled.</p>
                  <p>Note that labeling information is dispersed in both of these cases so the <code>title</code> attribute could be used instead.</p>

      <div class="guideline_content">
        <p class="summary">
        Write links so that a user who is aware of the topic of the page will understand the purpose of the link when reading <span class="with-color">one</span> of the following:</p>
        <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered"> 
          <li><span class="with-color">Link Text Alone:</span> Link text out of context (preferred if possible without awkwardness or redundant text)</li>
          <li><span class="with-color">Nearest Heading, Nearest Parent List Item, or Table Headers:</span> Link text and the nearest heading above the link, OR link text and the nearest parent list item in a nested list, OR link text in a data table cell and the cell's table headers (These options are only available where semantic markup is possible as in HTML.)</li>
          <li><span class="with-color">Sentence:</span> Link text and the sentence that contains the link. </li>
          <li><span class="with-color">Link Pattern:</span> Link text within the context of other links preceding the link on the same page.</li>
        </ul>
         
        <h3>Rationale</h3>
        <p>All users need to understand where links go without following each link. Screen reader users and users who use high magnification levels can't take in an overview of the whole page at once the way that a typical user might. This guideline is designed to limit the amount of the page that needs to be explored each time a user attempts to identify a link of interest. This is essential for efficient use of Web content.</p>
        <p>When Link Text Alone is used, users will quickly know the purpose of the link regardless of how they arrived at the link. However, in some cases, providing the full purpose of the link within the link text itself can result in a wordy experience for all users. </p>
        <p>Users typically arrive at a link:</p>
        <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered"> 
          <li><p>When reading the text leading up to the link</p>
              <p>OR</p>
          </li>
          <li>When reading through a list of all the links on the page</li>
        </ul>
        <p>As such, Nearest Heading, Sentence, and Link Pattern often provide the context needed without requiring any additional exploration of the page.</p>
        <p>Also, if the information is not known when the user first arrives at the link, Nearest Heading, Sentence/Line and Link Pattern can each be easily discovered using keyboard navigation as shown in the following charts:</p>

        <p>Also, users with cognitive issues should not have to decode too much of the page to understand a link.</p>

        <h3>General Techniques</h3>
        <p>When images or portions of images are used as links, two versions of the link text need evaluation: </p>
        <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered"> 
          <li><p>the alt-text, which will be the face of the link for screen readers users</p>
              <p>AND</p>
          </li>
          <li>the link as an image, which will be the face of the link for many users, including most screen magnification users</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>HTML &amp; JavaScript</h3>
        <h4>HTML | XHTML | CSS</h4>
        <ol class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--ordered">
          <li><p><strong>Link Text Alone:</strong> Write link text so that it describes the purpose of the link:</p>
            <pre><code>&lt;a href="http://www.google.com"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;</code></pre>
            <p>OR</p>
          </li>
          <li><p><strong>Sentence:</strong> If the link is inside a sentence of text, screen reader users can hear the link text, and then request to hear the current sentence to get further information about the link.</p>
              <p>OR</p>
          </li>
          <li><p><strong>Nearest Heading, Nearest Parent List Item, or Table Headers:</strong> HTML headings are an easy way to provide context for links. Keyboard access users can navigate to the heading just above the link for context.</p>
            <pre><code>&lt;h1&gt;Products&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;JAWS 10.0&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="jaws_trial.html"&gt;Download Trial&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="jaws_purchase"&gt;Purchase&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&lt;a href="about_jaws.html"&gt;Read More&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Zoom Text 10.0&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="zoom_trial.html"&gt;Download Trial&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&lt;a href="zoom_purchase"&gt;Purchase&lt;/a&gt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&lt;a href="about_zoom.html"&gt;Read More&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</code></pre>
             <p>Similarly, table headers and parent list items can provide context for links in html.</p>
            <p>OR</p>
          </li>
          <li><p><strong>Link Patterns:</strong> Screen reader users and screen magnification users often navigate a page by skipping from link to link. When one link provides context for the links that follow, these users will not need additional information to understand the links. In the example below, the links "JAWS" and "ZoomText" provide context for the links that follow them.</p>
            <pre><code>
&lt;a href="jaws_home.html"&gt;JAWS&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;a href="jaws_trial.html" title="JAWS Trial"&gt;Trial&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;a href="jaws_purchase" title="Purchase JAWS"&gt;Purchase&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href="zoom_home.html"&gt;ZoomText&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;a href="zoom_trial.html" title="ZoomText Trial"&gt;Trial&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;a href="zoom_purchase" title="Purchase ZoomText"&gt;Purchase&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</code></pre>
          <p>To achieve standards compliance, supplement link patterns with <code>title</code> attributes that fully describe the purpose of the link. <code>title</code> attributes aren't well supported in assistive technologies today. But, combining link patterns and title attributes covers both practical accessibility and standards compliance.</p>
          <p>Link Patterns with Titles Sample Page: <mark><a href="Link_Patterns.html">This Window</a> | <a href="Link_Patterns.html" target="_blank">New Window</a></mark></p></li>
        </ol>

        <h4>JavaScript</h4>
        <ol class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--ordered">
          <li><p>If dynamic user options result in differing results for links, use JavaScript to update the link text as needed:</p> 
            <pre><code>function updateLinkText() {
  document.getElementById('n').childNodes[0].nodeValue='Skip to the advanced questions!';
}</code></pre>
              . . .
            <pre><code>&lt;a href="variable_URL.html" id="n"&gt;Read about the European Renaissance!&lt;/a&gt;</code></pre>
          </li>
          <li><p>If an image is used as a link, and the meaning of the link changes (e.g. plus symbol changes to minus symbol, play button changes to a pause button) update the alt-text for the image:</p>
            <pre><code>document.getElementById('c').alt='Collapse menu';</code></pre>
              . . .
            <pre><code>&lt;img src="plus.gif" alt="Expand menu" id="c" /&gt;</code></pre>
          </li>
        </ol>
        
        <h3>Android Applications</h3>
        <p>The approaches for descriptive link text for Android mobile applications is similar to HTML webpages.   One of the following can be used: </p>
        <ol class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--ordered">
          <li><strong>Link Text Alone:</strong>  write link text so it is unique and describes the purpose of the link</li>
          <li><strong>Sentence: </strong> If the link is inside the sentence of text, the screen reader can read the sentence to the context of the link.</li>
          <li><strong>Nearest Heading or Table Headers :</strong> Screen readers can jump to the heading or table headers to get the context for the link. </li>
          <li><strong>Link Patterns:</strong>  Screen reader and screen magnifier users often navigate a page by skipping from link to link.  The previous link can provide context for the links that follow.  To achieve standards compliance, use the android:contentDescription to provide descriptive link text.  The contentDescription should include the full link text.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h3>iOS Applications</h3>
        <p>The approaches for descriptive link text for iOS mobile applications is similar to HTML webpages.   One of the following can be used: </p>
        <ol class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--ordered">
          <li><strong>Link Text Alone:</strong> write link text so it is unique and describes the purpose of the link</li>
          <li><strong>Sentence: </strong> If the link is inside the sentence of text, the screen reader can read the sentence to the context of the link.</li>
          <li><strong>Nearest Heading or Table Headers :</strong> Screen readers can jump to the heading or table headers to get the context for the link.</li>
          <li><strong>Link Patterns:</strong> Screen reader and screen magnifier users often navigate a page by skipping from link to link. The previous link can provide context for the links that follow. To achieve standards compliance, define descriptive link text by setting the label and hint to provide contextual information. The label and the hint together should be the full link text.</li>
        </ol> 
        
        <h3>PDF in Acrobat</h3>
        <p>The link tag is used to define hyperlinks that are either internal or external to the PDF document. The link tag can be a child of other tags such as the paragraph tag.</p>
        <p>To create a link in Acrobat 9 Pro, select the text that will be used for the link text. Access the context menu and select Create Link. Select the link appearance and choose the link action. To create an internal link, select "go to a page view". An external link can be either a file or a web page.<br>
          <img alt="" width="339" height="267" src="images/create-link-internal.jpg"></p>
        <p>The next screen will specify the location of the link. For internal links, select the target view using the scrollbars, mouse and zoom. Press Set Link to create the link destination.<br>
          <img alt="" width="248" height="167" src="images/create-go-view.jpg"></p>
        
        <h4>Screen Reader Behavior Tips</h4>
        <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
          <li>The tooltip created using the link dialog in Adobe Acrobat is not accessible to screen readers. The link text or the link context needs to make the purpose clear.</li>
          <li>To change the text spoken by screen readers for links, set the Alternative Text for the link. Go to the properties of the Link tag and on the Tag tab set the Alternative Text.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Word</h3>
        <p>As with HTML links, ensure that the text will be understood by the user in the context of the surrounding text and content structure, and that it makes sense out of context. Screen reader users can browse a list of links, so "General PDF Accessibility Guidelines" is better than "click here." Verify that the links are active.</p>
        <p>To set the text of the link, change the Text to display text in the Hyperlink properties dialog box.<br>
          <img alt="The first form field in the Insert Hyperlink dialog box allows users to change the text to display for the link." width="424" height="203" src="images/Insert_hyperlink.jpg"></p>
        <p>Avoid using the URL as the display text. Listening to long URLs can be tedious for a screen reader user and could cause them to abandon the content. Concise, meaningful descriptions as link text are helpful.</p>
         
        <h3>PowerPoint</h3>
        <p>As with HTML links, ensure that the text will be understood by the user in the context of the surrounding text and content structure, and that it makes sense out of context. Screen reader users can browse a list of links, so "PowerPoint Accessibility Guidelines" is better than "click here." Verify that the destination of each link is valid.</p>
        <p>It is easier for screen reader users when links contain concise, meaningful display text rather than URLs. Listening to long URLs can be tedious for them and could cause them to abandon the content. PowerPoint will autocorrect text that clearly looks like a URL to be a link (e.g. http://... And www.) Allow it to do this or use ctrl-K or Insert &gt; hyperlink to add links. This is better than forcing links to be in plain text. Link text should be differentiated from other content with an underline and/or a high-contrast text color.<br>
          <img alt="In the Insert Hyperlink dialog box, enter the meaningful display text in the text to display textbox." width="450" height="215" src="images/PowerPoint-links.jpg"></p>

                <p>Using the Select Object tool, right-click each link to check its properties. In Acrobat 9, this is under Tools &gt; Advanced Editing &gt; Select Object; in Acrobat 10 it is under Tools &gt; Content. Verify that the link properties are set to visible, inset, thin underline, and that the action is set appropriately (page view, file, or web page), and for web pages, that the URL is fully qualified, using <code>http://</code>.</p>
                <p>In the tags pane, verify that the link is represented within the tag for the surrounding text and as a link tag containing an object reference (OBJR) and a text container for the link display text. For example, a paragraph of text is represented by a <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tag. There will often be at least three container elements within that tag:</p>

        <h4>HTML | XHTML | CSS</h4>
        <ol class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--ordered">
          <li>In the opening HTML tag add a language attribute as follows:

              <li><p>In XHTML 1.0 use both the <code>lang</code> and <code>xml:lang</code> attributes. XHTML 1.0 can be served as either text/html or xml. If XHTML is served as text/html, it requires both attributes. Since content maybe be reused on varying servers, it is safest to use both attributes.</p>

          </li>
          <li><p>Add language attributes for any content whose language is different from the default language of the page. The attribute can be added to any tag:</p>
            <pre><code>&lt;!-- xhtml 1.0 --&gt;
&lt;p lang="de" xml:lang="de"&gt;Wenn Sie in der Textantwort einen Absatz erzeugen möchten, geben Sie am Anfang des Absatzes und am Ende des Absatzes ein.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
            <p>If needed, add a span tag to enclose just the text that is in the additional language:</p>
            <pre><code>&lt;!-- html --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said, &lt;span lang="fr"&gt;"Bonjour!"&lt;/span&gt;, which was a surprise since they didn't know he could talk.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h4>JavaScript</h4>
        <p>If content is changed or added, or, in particular, translated, update the language attributes as well:</p>
        <pre><code>/* html French */
document.getElementsByTagName('html')[0].lang = 'fr';

/* xhtml 1.1 English */
document.getElementsByTagName('html')[0].setAttribute('xml:lang','en');</code></pre>
        
        <h3>Android Applications</h3>
        <p>Android applications can set the default language using the <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/java/util/Locale.html">Locale</a> class. The languages supported are English, French, Chinese, German, Italian, Japanese and Korean.</p>

        <h3>iOS Applications</h3>
        <p>The language for interface elements is set using the <code>accessibilityLanguage</code> property. For every language supported, a localized label or text can be provided. Voiceover by default speaks the language that the user specifies in the International property settings.</p>
        <p>VoiceOver supports the following languages: Arabic, Chinese (Cantonese), Chinese (China), Chinese (Taiwan), Czech, Danish, Dutch, English (Australia), English (Britain), English (Irish), English (South African), English (United States), Finnish, Flemish (Belgian Dutch), French (Canadian), French (France), German, Greek, Hindi, Hungarian, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese (Brazil), Portuguese (Portugal), Romanian, Russian, Slovak, Spanish (Mexico), Spanish (Spain), Swedish, Thai, Turkish.</p>

        <h3>PDF in Acrobat</h3>
        <p>Within the PDF document, both the document language and any changes of language within the document can be specified. </p>

        <h4>Setting the Document Language</h4>
        <p>To indicate the primary document language, go to the document properties at File &gt; Properties. On the Advanced tab there is an option to select the language. Choose the appropriate language in the drop-down list. If the language is not in the drop down list, type the <a href="https://www.w3.org/International/articles/language-tags/">language code</a> into the field that has the drop down.<br>
        <img src="images/doc-lang.jpg" width="322" height="349" alt=""></p>
        
        <h4>Changes of Language within a Document</h4>
        <p>If the document contains text in a language other than the primary document language, that text needs to be defined as the appropriate language. The easiest way to do this is to find the tag that contains the text. Right-click the tag and select Properties in the context menu. In the tags tab, the properties dialog has an option to select the language from a drop-down list. If the language is not in the drop down list, type the <a href="https://www.w3.org/International/articles/language-tags/">language code</a> into the field that has the drop down.<br>
        <img src="images/tag-lang.jpg" width="258" height="241" alt=""></p>
        <p>If there is a word or phrase within a sentence that needs to be defined as a different language, first split the original content using the TouchUp Reading Order (TURO) tool. This will create three tags. Check to make sure the tags are in the correct order and set the language of the text. All three tags should be at the same level beneath the parent tag.</p>
         
        <h3>Word</h3>
        <p>In Word, set both the primary document language and any changes in language within the document.</p>
        
        <h4>Document Language</h4>
        <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
          <li>Word 2010 reports the document language to assistive technology. Set this in File &gt; Info &gt; Properties (a dropdown) &gt; Show Document Panel.</li>
          <li>In Word 2007, set the language in Office Button &gt; Prepare &gt; Properties &gt; Custom, but this is not reported to assistive technology.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Changes in Language</h4>
        <p>To set the language of text within a document, use the "Set Language" option on the Review tab, in the proofing group.</p>
        <p>If the language is not listed, install the language pack for that particular language. For more information, see the Microsoft help: <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Do-I-need-a-language-pack-Language-Accessory-Pack-LAP-or-a-Language-Interface-Pack-LIP-4548ec6b-6d0e-40aa-8780-7bbee9554e04">Determine if you need a language pack</a>.</p>

        <h3>PowerPoint</h3>
        <p>A screen reader will read content in the default language of the system unless a document identifies another language. If it tries to identify and read English words in German content, the result can be less than useful for the user.</p>
        <p>PowerPoint 2010 reports the document language to assistive technology. Set this in File &gt; Info &gt; Properties (a dropdown) &gt; Show Document Panel.</p>
        <p>In PowerPoint 2007, you can, and should set the language in Office Button &gt; Prepare &gt; Properties &gt; Custom, but this is not reported to assistive technology.</p>

      <h2 id="g17">Guideline 17. Write page and frame titles that give the purpose of the page or the frame (Page &amp; Frame Titles)</h2>
      <div class="guideline_content">
        <p class="summary">For each frame and for each primary media file (e.g. HTML page, Flash movie, PDF document) provide a title that:</p>
          <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered summary">
            <li><p>Reflects the purpose or topic of the frame or file</p>
              <p>AND</p>
            </li>
            <li>Differentiates the frame or file from the others in your site</li>
          </ul>
         
        <h3>Rationale</h3>
        <p>Well-written titles allow screen reader users to move between windows, documents or frames with confidence.</p>
        <p>Additional Benefits: Search engines often use titles when displaying search results. Many users use titles to select between open windows in common operating systems.</p>

        <h3>General Techniques</h3>
        <p>Write titles that convey the purpose of the item and that are as unique as possible within the context of your site. For example, as of January 2009, Google wisely provides the search term(s) as the first part of the title, followed the more general information, "Google Search".</p>
        
        <h3>HTML Techniques</h3>
        <ol class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--ordered">
          <li>Give each HTML page one <code>title</code> element that reflects the purpose or the topic of the page:
           <pre><code>&lt;title&gt;All about Elephants&lt;/title&gt;</code></pre>
          </li>
          <li>Do not include any markup between the opening and closing <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> tags.</li>
          <li>Give each <code>frame</code> or <code>iframe</code> a <code>title</code> attribute that reflects the purpose of the frame:
           <pre><code>&lt;frame src="elephants.html"         name="content"         title="Main Content"&gt;</code></pre>
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Android Applications</h3>
        <p>The screen title should be unique and provide information to orient the user to screen. In Android applications the title of the screen is provided setting the <code>android:Label</code> on the <code>Activity</code> class or using the <code>setTitle</code> method.</p>

        <h3>iOS Applications</h3>
        <p>The screen title should be unique and provide information to orient the user to screen.</p> 
        <p>If the application uses the iOS navigation bar, this is accessible by default. The default accessibility trait for a navigation bar is User Interaction Enabled. The navigation bar title should be set to the screen title and should change to the new level’s title when the screen changes.</p>

        <h3>PDF in Acrobat</h3>
        <p>In a PDF document, the title should represent the content of the PDF file. The document title is defined in the document properties.</p>
        <p>In Acrobat, go to Document Properties, and enter a title. In Acrobat 9 on Windows, this is found under File &gt; Properties (Control D) &gt; Description Tab &gt; Title Field.<br>
          <img src="images/doc-title.jpg" width="450" height="280" alt=""></p>
        <p>To have the document title display in the title bar of the user agent, set the show drop down to Document Title in the Initial View tab.<br>
          <img src="images/doc-showtitle.jpg" width="279" height="273" alt=""></p>

        <h3>Word</h3>
        <p>Set the document properties to identify the title and subject of the document using the Word document settings.</p>
        <p>To set the document properties:</p>
        <ol class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--ordered">
          <li>Go to the Office button</li>
          <li>Select Prepare - Properties</li>
          <li>Set the document author, title, subject and keywords</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>PowerPoint</h3>
        <p>Set the PowerPoint document properties to identify the title and subject of the document.</p>
        <p>To set the document properties:</p>
        <ol class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--ordered">
          <li>Go to the Office button</li>
          <li>Select Prepare - Properties</li>

      <h2 id="g18">Guideline 18. Consider all users while writing instructions for user interfaces (User Interface Instructions)</h2>
      <div class="guideline_content">
        <p class="summary">When identifying features of user interfaces in instructions and help content, include semantic information and labels as opposed to <span class="with-color">exclusively</span> referring to visual formatting (e.g. "the option furthest to the right", "in the blue area") or to auditory information (e.g. "when you hear a beep").</p>

        <h3>Rationale</h3>
        <p>Students who use assistive technologies (e.g. screen readers, custom style sheets) do not expect help content to provide information on using the assistive technologies. However, it is essential that they receive the same guidance about the media as other students. The key to this is ensuring that all students can identify the media elements that are being described in instructions and help content.</p>
        
        <h3>General Techniques</h3>
        <ol class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--ordered">
          <li><p>These PGs explain how to make essential information available to all users through semantic markup and text. This semantic information should be used to describe media elements as opposed to exclusively using descriptions of the visual or auditory aspects of the elements.</p>
            <p>For example, <a href="#g14">PG 14</a> ensures that labels are explicitly associated with form elements, so the following text would work well on a help page to identify a form element:</p>
            <pre><code>&lt;!-- Reasonable text for a Help System --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enter your name in the form field labeled
   Student Name at the top right corner of the page.&lt;/p&gt;
</code></pre>
            <p>However, the following text does not mention the label and so could be confusing to students using screen readers and to students using a custom style sheet that changes the location of the form element on the page:</p>
            <pre><code>&lt;!-- Not Recommended --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enter your name in the form field at
   the top right corner of the page.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
          </li>
          <li>This guideline does not mean to discourage mentioning color, sound, shape, size or location on the screen, as these descriptors can be very helpful for some students. In general, students who have transformed the media using assistive technology are aware that they've transformed it and will gladly ignore descriptors that don't work for them when descriptors that do work for them are also present.</li>
          <li>"Top of the page" and "bottom of the page" mention visual location but pass this guideline without further clarification as long as the content referred to is at the top or bottom (respectively) of the reading order (See <a href="#g4">PG 4</a>).</li>
          <li>"Click" is understood by mouse users and keyboard access users alike. It is fine to use "Click" in your instructions, and when compared with alternatives, "Click" usually results in clearer instructions for all users.</li>

      <h2 id="g19">Guideline 19. Use properly nested markup tags and correct spelling (Valid Markup &amp; Spelling)</h2>
      <div class="guideline_content">
        <p class="summary">When using markup languages (e.g. HTML, XHTML, SMIL) follow the specifications for the language and test for errors using a validator. When using human languages (e.g. English, Hindi, Japanese) test for spelling errors using a spell checker. </p>
        <p>Note: The intent of this guideline is to avoid typing errors, tagging errors and accidentally invalid markup. Occasionally, developers will have valid reasons for markup that will not validate in a tool. Such conscious decisions are acceptable and can simply be noted in your accessibility documentation.</p>

        <h3>Rationale</h3>
        <p>Testing in supported visual browsers can help find some errors in markup. However, browsers often display Web pages rather well even when the pages do not follow the specifications for the markup.</p>
        <p>The errors that some browsers are able to overlook can cause issues when other tools (particularly screen readers) attempt to work with the markup.</p>
        <p>For example, screen reader users use special keystrokes to navigate data tables cell by cell. They listen to the data and to the relevant headers along the way. Occasionally a data table with a missing closing <code>&lt;/th&gt;</code> tag will look fine on many browsers. However, when a screen reader interprets the table, the missing tag can cause the wrong header to be associated with a particular data cell.</p>
        <p>Additional Benefit: Valid markup is less likely to break in new browser versions. It is also easier and less expensive to maintain than non-standard markup which often depends on browser quirks mode, reflecting legacy browser-specific behaviors. </p>
        <p>Misspellings that can are overlooked visually can make a big difference when a screenreader tries to pronounce the words. During recent accessibility reviews, we found that misspellings were greatly reducing the quality of the experience for screenreader users, even when the issues were minor for visual users.</p>

        <h3>General Techniques</h3>
        <p>If you find that specific elements of your markup do not validate, but you have valid reason for this markup, pay special attention to how those elements play in screen readers.</p>

        <ol class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--ordered">

          <li>Indicate the appropriate character encoding: <a href="http://www.w3.org/International/O-charset">http://www.w3.org/International/O-charset</a></li>

        </ol>

        <h5>Validate during Development</h5>
        <ol class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--ordered">
          <li>Use a tool to validate your markup, such as: <a href="http://validator.w3.org/">http://validator.w3.org/</a></li>
          <li>Test your validator to be sure that you understand whether markup that is hidden through CSS will be tested. The W3C validator is able to test markup hidden through <code>display:none</code> and throughor <code>visibility:hidden</code>.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h4>JavaScript</h4>
        <h5>Development</h5>
        <ol class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--ordered">
          <li>When adding HTML/XHTML elements or text content, manipulate the document object module (DOM), rather than using <code>document.write</code> or <code>innerHTML</code>. <code>innerHTML</code> is non-standard. Both <code>document.write</code> and <code>innerHTML</code> do not always write proper nodes to the Document Object Model tree. This may become an issue for custom and future assistive technologies, so DOM manipulation is best for future-compatibility. (Legacy content that is expected to be retired in the next year or two, may use these without significantly degrading the experience for users with disabilities.)</li>
          <li>When manipulating the DOM, ensure that the markup generated meets validation standards. For example, if using JavaScript to create new nodes with ids ensure that the ids are unique.</li>
        </ol>

        <h5>Validate during Development</h5>
        <ol class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--ordered">
          <li><p>Test your validator to be sure you understand which JavaScript-generated markup it tests. For example, the W3C validator (<a href="http://validator.w3.org/">http://validator.w3.org/</a>) checks markup that is written into the page using JavaScript while the page is loaded. But, it does not check any markup that is written based on choices the user makes onscreen. In order to test this markup:</p>
           <p>OR</p>
          </li>
          <li>indicate user choice through a query string so that each choice has a URL which can be validated</li>
          <li>include a testing mode in your script which allows you to temporarily hard-code user choices during validation</li>
        </ol>
 
        <h3>Related Guidelines</h3>
        <h4>WCAG 2.0 Level A – SC 4.1.1 Parsing</h4>
        <p>In content implemented using markup languages, elements have complete start and end tags, elements are nested according to their specifications, elements do not contain duplicate attributes, and any IDs are unique, except where the specifications allow these features. (Level A)</p>
        <p>Note: Start and end tags that are missing a critical character in their formation, such as a closing angle bracket or a mismatched attribute value quotation mark are not complete. </p>

      <h2 id="g20">Guideline 20. Make sure screen readers can speak info about controls (e.g. "checkbox, selected") (UI Control Role, Name, State &amp; Options)</h2>
      <div class="guideline_content">
        <p class="summary">Use standard user input controls (e.g. HTML form controls, Flash accessible components) for their intended purpose or, if no appropriate standard controls exist, create or repurpose controls so that screen readers present the role, name, current state (including changes in state) and available options.</p>
        
        <h3>Rationale</h3>
        <p>When you choose to include a standard user interface element in a piece of media, it comes with much more than is seen by the typical user. For example, in HTML if you place a set of radio buttons on the screen, screen reader users will hear what the control is, how many options there are, what the options are*, which option is currently selected and which option has focus. In addition, screen reader users can work through the screen reader to select an option.</p>
        <p>When we create custom UI components, we need to ensure that the same information is available and that the same interactions can take place.</p>
        <p>*Requires proper labeling, see <a href="#g14">PG 14</a></p>
        
        <h3>General Techniques</h3>
        <h4>Use standard controls, when they meet the need</h4>
        <p>When possible, use a pre-existing standard UI control. These will work well in more assistive technologies than you'll be able to test in, and users will be used to using them.</p>
        
        <h4>When creating a custom UI control or evaluating/fixing a custom UI control from a Library:</h4>
        <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
          <li>Give each control a name or label much like the labels used for standard form controls, as described in <a href="#g14">PG 14</a>. Test with a screen reader to be sure the name or label is available to the screen reader.</li>
          <li>Indicate the role of each control. In other words, indicate what type of UI control it is (e.g. pulldown menu, link, radio button). This provides insight into how the control will be used and, in the best cases, allows screen readers to walk users through the process of using the control. Test with a screen reader to be sure this information is available to the screen reader.</li>
          <li>Indicate the state of each control. In other words, indicate which option is currently selected. Test with a screen reader to be sure that screen reader users will know the state of the control.</li>
          <li>Make sure the list of options is available to screen reader as well. Test with a screen reader to be sure the options are available and can be selected through a screen reader.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>HTML &amp; JavaScript</h3>
        <h4>When standard HTML elements are used creatively</h4>
        <p>Often CSS and images are used with form elements, image maps and links to create controls that appear to be custom widgets, but that are actually standard HTML elements. For example, a piano interface can be created using a simple image map:</p>
        <pre><code>&lt;map name="piano"&gt;
  &lt;area shape="rect" coords="20,20,40,40" onclick="play('c');" alt="C"&gt;
  &lt;area shape="rect" coords="50,20,70,40" onclick="play('d');" alt="D"&gt;
  &lt;area shape="rect" coords="80,20,100,40" onclick="play('e');" alt="E"&gt;
  &lt;area shape="rect" coords="110,20,130,40" onclick="play('f');" alt="F"&gt;
  &lt;area shape="rect" coords="140,20,160,40" onclick="play('g');" alt="G"&gt;
&lt;/map&gt;
&lt;img src="piano.gif" width="180" height="60" alt="Select a note to play the note" usemap="#piano" /&gt;</code></pre>
        <p>Whenever using HTML/XHTML elements in unique ways, follow basic accessibility standards, like adding alt-text and form labels. Also, be sure to test the experience with a screen reader. In the example above, testing with a screen reader and user testing with screen reader users reveals that many users would like to turn off the alt-text for each key, once they've read through the keys a couple times. To do this, you can position a link for this off screen so that it will be available only to screen reader users:</p>
        <pre><code>
.screen_readers_only {
  position: absolute;
  left: -999px;
  top: auto;
  width: 1px;
  height: 1px;
  overflow: hidden;
}</code></pre>
        <p>Connect the link to a JavaScript that uses the DOM to set the alt-text for each <code>area</code> element to null.</p>
        
        <h4>Links that make changes to the page | Toggle buttons</h4>
        <p>Sometimes seemingly simple links can be custom controls requiring role and state information.</p>
        <p>Normally, a link brings you to a new location. When this is the case, the role information that automatically comes with a link is appropriate and no state information is needed.</p>
        
        <h4>Role</h4>
        <p>However, if a link is used with JavaScript to make changes to the page, it may need both role and state information. There are several ways to provide role information for this type of link or button:</p>
        <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
          <li>The link text might make this clear on it's own. For example a screen reader will read an a <code>href</code> element with link text of "Show Details about Registration", as "Show Details about Registration Link". That makes the situation pretty clear.</li>
          <li><p>A <code>&lt;button&gt;</code> or an <code>&lt;input type="image"&gt;</code> element can be used instead of a link element. This will cause screen readers to announce a role of "button" rather than a role of "link". This more accurately describes the control and helps to let screen reader users know what to expect. This is a particularly good idea if this item looks like a button visually. This will help facilitate conversations about the user interface between blind and sighted users. You can control the appearance of the HTML <code>button</code> element using CSS:</p>
            <pre><code>button.clearformatting {
/* remove browser-provided 3d edge effect */
  border: 0;
/* remove extra spacing, and animated effect */
  padding: 0;
/* remove color assigned by browser */
  background: transparent;
/* add any formatting you like */
  background: url('button_texture.gif') repeat;
}</code></pre>
          </li>
          <li>Another option if you'd like your element announced as a button, but you are using a link, is to use the WAI-ARIA <code>role</code> attribute to change an <code>&lt;a href&gt;</code> element's role to button: <code>role="button"</code>.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>State</h4>
        <p>Links and buttons that change the page often require state information. In general, ask yourself, "Will users know which choice is currently active, without exploring the page, and without trying options multiple times to compare the differences?" If the answer is "no", you need to add state information.</p>
        <p>There are several ways to provide role information for this type of link or button:</p>
        <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
          <li>CLEAN UP The example above suggests adding a link that toggles alt-text on and off for some piano keys. In this case, the script that toggles the alt-text on and off should change the link text to reflect the current state (i.e. "turn off alt-text", "turn on alt-text").</li>
          <li>ARIA</li>
          <li>Finally, you might choose to use a completely different type of control! Consider again, the controls to turn off alt-text for piano keys in the example described above. Two radio buttons might be used, instead, as these standard HTML form elements automatically provide information about their state to screen readers. For example, a screen reader would present this set of radio buttons as "radio button, one of two, alt-text on, checked".</li>
          <li>If you need to create a complex custom UI element, check JavaScript libraries to see if someone has already developed and tested an accessible UI control that meets the need. Libraries to check include:Be sure that the documentation indicates that the specific item is accessible &amp; still be sure to test with a screen reader. 
            <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">

            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Do not use inaccessible components of JavaScript libraries without adapting them for accessibility. Keep in mind, if the component is not accessible, using a library can make it more difficult to add accessibility. This is because the JavaScript code used in libraries is often more complex than JavaScript written especially for the task at hand.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>ARIA / HTML 5 Widgets</h3>
        <p>This section will be updated with additional widgets as testing confirms that the HTML 5 and the Web Accessibility Initiative, Accessible Rich Internet Applications (WAI-ARIA) elements and attributes are well supported.</p>
        
        <h4>Slider / Range</h4>
        <p>Sliders are user interface controls that allow users to select a value from a range of values. Sliders define minimum and maximum values.</p>
        <p>Eventually, the HTML 5 <code>&lt;input type="range"&gt;</code> element will be a way to create a slider. However, as November 2012, most browsers render these as simple text inputs. (That's for all users.) </p>
        <p>So, for now, sliders are usually created using JavaScript or using JavaScript libraries. To make these custom controls accessible, use WAI-ARIA (or a library that uses WAI-ARIA). (And don't forget to make the slider keyboard accessible. You should be able to tab to the slider, and use the arrow keys to change the value.)</p>
        <p>Here are the WAI-ARIA attributes to use:</p>
        <table class="pe-table">
          <tr>
            <th scope="row"><code>role="slider"</code></th>
            <td>Says, "this is a slider"</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <th scope="row"><code>value-now="5"</code></th>
            <td>Gives the current value. Use JavaScript to update this as the slider is moved.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <th scope="row"><code>value-min="0"</code></th>
            <td>Says, "this is the lowest value allowed". This value shouldn't change as the slider is used.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <th scope="row"><code>value-max="176"</code></th>
            <td>Says, "this is the highest value allowed". This value shouldn't change as the slider is used.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <th scope="row"><code>value-text="5 balloons"</code></th>
            <td>Use this to tell screen readers how you'd like the value-now value to be expressed.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <th scope="row"><code> aria-label="Mylar balloons for your party" or aria-labelledby="idOfOnScreenLabel"</code></th>
            <td>Use this to tell screen readers users which slider this is.</td>
          </tr>
      </table>

        <p>Here are JavaScript Library Sliders that already have these built in:</p>

        </ul>

        <h3>Android Applications</h3>
        <p>The role, name, state and options are provided for standard widgets and extensions of standard widgets. Use <code>contentDescription</code> to provide role and changes of state information for custom controls.</p>
        <p>See <a href="https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/accessibility/apps.html#custom-views">Android's Custom View documentation</a> for information on supporting the directional controller and on how to implement the accessibility API methods.</p>
        
        <h3>iOS Applications</h3>
        <p>In iOS native UIKit views and controls will automatically have most of the necessary accessibility properties set. See <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit">UIKit User Interface Catalog</a> for specific information about the different views and controls and what is required to make them accessible.</p>
        <p>Custom accessible interface elements, should define the attributes for label, traits, and value as needed for the type of interface element. If additional information is needed to communicate how to interact with a control, use the <code>accessibilityHint</code> property. </p>
        <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
          <li><strong>Label</strong> – defines the name of the control</li>
          <li><strong>Traits</strong> – describes element’s state, behavior or usage. A control can have more than one trait. View the full list of traits.</li>
          <li><strong>Value</strong> – current value of an element</li>
          <li><strong>Hint</strong> - additional information about a control</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Flash</h3>
        <h4>CheckBoxes and RadioButtons</h4>
        <p>When using Flash CheckBox and RadioButton Components, you need to include <code>enableAccessibility</code> so that screen readers will know these are not just buttons, but are RadioButtons or CheckBoxes and so that screen readers will convey the state of the control (e.g. checked/unchecked). This code varies slightly depending on your authoring environment, so get the code from the code library of your particular authoring tool. Here are the steps in CS3:</p>
        <ol class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--ordered">
          <li>Window</li>
          <li>Actions</li>
          <li>(if needed) Show Toolbox</li>
          <li>fl.accessibility (or similar)</li>
          <li>Open the folder for the component you used.</li>
          <li>Drag "enableAccessibility" into the code window.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>To make fully accessible checkBoxes and radioButtons, see also Pearson Guideline 14, which discusses providing labels for form controls.</p>

      <h2 id="g21">Guideline 21. Use encoded text instead of images of text (Encoded Text)</h2>
      <div class="guideline_content">
        <p class="summary">Use encoded text instead of images of text except:</p>
          <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
            <li><p>Where the particular presentation is essential (e.g. image of an ancient manuscript, hand writing sample, screen capture, logo)</p>
              <p>OR</p>
            </li>
            <li>Where the text in question is not the main body copy and images of text are the only way to achieve the design goals (e.g. special font, anti-aliasing)</li>
          </ul>
         
        <h3>Rationale</h3>
        <p>The most basic type of text that you experience in email and text documents is called encoded text. Since computers understand encoded text as characters, encoded text is more flexible than images of text, which computers typically understand as a collection of pixels. Many user agents allow users to increase the size of both encoded text and images of text. However, particularly for large blocks of text, encoded text reflows better allowing users to avoid horizontal scrolling.</p>
        <p>Perhaps more importantly, user agents often allow users to adjust the foreground/background colors and font of encoded text. This benefits students with vision issues such as sensitivity to glare. This also benefits students with learning disabilities such as dyslexia, for whom reading can be considerably easier when text is rendered in particular color schemes.</p>
        <p>Also some students with learning disabilities use screen readers that highlight the text as they read. These highlight effects do not work with images of text.</p>
        <p>Additional Benefits: Encoded text (in place of images of text) eases localization.</p>
        
        <h3>HTML</h3>
        <h4>CSS can be used to Format Encoded Text</h4>
        <p>For example:</p>
        <pre><code>h1 {
  font-family: "Trebuchet MS", sans-serif;
  letter-spacing: .21em;
  line-height: 1.5em;
  margin-bottom: .2em;
}</code></pre>

        <h4>Buttons with Rounded Edges can use Encoded Text</h4>
        <p><mark>Often Web designers create images of text in order to create buttons with rounded edges. CSS background images can be used to create similar buttons and tabs using encoded text. If you'd like the width of the button or tab to adjust to the text length, one option is <a href="https://alistapart.com/article/slidingdoors">A List Apart's sliding doors technique</a> (outdated technique?)</mark>. Here is an example of a button formatted using this type of technique:</p>
        <pre><code>button.round {
  border:0;
  padding:0 19px 0 0;
/* Give button element a background image
   wide enough to cover the widest button
   you may need. The right side of the image
   is rounded. */
  background:transparent url('rt.gif') no-repeat right;
}
button.round span {
  display:block;
  white-space:nowrap;
/* Give span element inside button element
   a background image with just the curve to
   round-off the left side. This overlaps the
   button background image, hiding the left
   side of that image */
  background:transparent url('lf.gif') no-repeat left;
/* specify height matching image height */
  height: 24px;
/* Adjust text position using line-height and
   padding where: line-height + padding-top +
   padding-bottom = height */
  line-height: 20px;
  padding: 2px 0 2px 25px;
}</code></pre>
        <pre><code>&lt;button type="button" class="round"&gt;
  &lt;span&gt;Text between button tags&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/button&gt;</code></pre>

        <h4>Images are Not Needed for Rollover Effects</h4>
        <p>Often, rollover effects are created by replacing one image of text with another image of text. Instead, CSS pseudo classes <code>:hover</code>, <code>:focus</code> and <code>:active</code> can be use to create rollovers that work with encoded text. For example:</p>
        <pre><code>
/* mouse */
a:hover {
  background: url('texture_off.gif') repeat;
}
/* keyboard */
a:focus {
  background: url('texture_on.gif') repeat;
}
/* keyboard for IE */
a:active {
  background: url('texture_on.gif') repeat;
}</code></pre>
         
        <h3>PDF in Acrobat</h3>
        <p>In a PDF document, text is rendered for display using specific graphic designs that are captured in fonts called glyphs. The text content of pages is in glyphs not characters and the text is then interpreted using Unicode, a common character encoding technology. If a character used on the page does not have a Unicode equivalent, then the text cannot be read by screen readers.</p>
        <p>Common Issues:</p>
        <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
          <li>Non–standard bullet characters</li>
          <li>Symbols and other document markers</li>
          <li>Some fonts</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Techniques for Fixing Unicode Issues</h4>
        <p>If there are Unicode issues within the PDF document, running the full accessibility check in Acrobat will generate an error. To fix these errors, choose a different font and generate the PDF again.</p>
        <p>For characters and symbols:</p>
        <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
          <li>If the symbol or character does not convey information, change it to an artifact.</li>
          <li>If a character used conveys information, either change the font or add it as an image with alternative text. These changes will need to be made in the source document then converted to a PDF.</li>

        <h4>WCAG 2.0 Level AA – SC 1.4.5 Images of Text</h4>
        If the technologies being used can achieve the visual presentation, text is used to convey information rather than images of text except for the following: (Level AA) 
        <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
          <li>Customizable: The image of text can be visually customized to the user's requirements;</li>
          <li>Essential: A particular presentation of text is essential to the information being conveyed. Note: Logotypes (text that is part of a logo or brand name) are considered essential.</li>
        </ul>

      </div>

      <h2 id="g22">Guideline 22. Use text that users can resize (Text Resize)</h2>
      <div class="guideline_content">
        <p class="summary">Ensure that text size (except for captions) can be increased to at least 200% using controls in either the user agent (e.g. Web browser, PDF reader, Flash player) or the media. No content or functionality should be lost.</p>
        <p>Note: This is primarily the responsibility of the user agent. To address this guideline, we ensure that our content either does not interfere with the user agent's solution or provides a replacement for the user agent's solution.</p>

        <h3>Rationale</h3>
        <p>There are many ways that users can increase the size of text on the screen. People who need high levels of magnification use dedicated screen magnification software (e.g. ZoomText, MAGic). Operating systems generally provide magnification utilities with their accessibility options. Adjusting monitor resolution can also achieve increased text sizes. And Web browsers allow this through custom style sheets.</p>
        <p>However, many users with minor vision or reading comfort issues rely on the basic resize features built into the user agent to increase text size just a little. Some users also work with a combination of dedicated screen magnification software and browser features, to achieve an optimal text-size. As such, it is important that the media content does not disable or interfere with these features.</p>

        <h3>General Techniques</h3>
        <h4>All of the Text</h4>
        <p>Be sure <strong>all</strong> of the text can be resized, including text in the navigation and on the buttons</p>
          
        <h4>Supporting the User Agent's (e.g. browser, player) solution</h4>
        <p>Test the media with the resize and zoom features of supported user agents and fix any issues that are found.</p>
          
        <h4>Creating your own text resize feature</h4>
        <p>Creating your own text resize feature is only needed if:</p>
        <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
          <li>None of your supported user agents on a particular platform have resize features</li>
          <li>Or, if you choose not to support the resize features of your supported user agents</li>
        </ul>
          
        <h4>Special Consideration for Reading Experiences</h4>
        <p>When the primary purpose of the product is to deliver a reading experience, as is the case in an eBook reader, we recommend ensuring that text within the main reading panel reflows. Text reflow is probably of considerably less importance when there is just a bit of text on a screen with many controls. Scrolling horizontally to read one line of instructions or to reach a control is likely to be a reasonable user experience. However, when there are hours of reading and studying to be done with the main text of a product, horizontal scrolling within that main text area makes for a bad user experience.</p>

        <h3>HTML &amp; JavaScript</h3>
        <h4>Supporting Internet Explorer 6 or Earlier</h4>
        <p>If you need to support IE 6 or earlier, do not set font size using pixels. Instead use ems, exs, percentages or named sizes (e.g. <code>small</code>, <code>medium</code>).</p>
        <h4>Solving Common Problems with Browser Zoom</h4>
        <p>Usually browser zoom features will work without any adjustments; however, some minor issues may be discovered, for example: </p>
        <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
          <li>You may find that you need to set scrolling to auto for frames, so that scrollbars will appear when needed. </li>
          <li>You may also find that you need to allow windows to be resized.</li>
          <li>You may find that a column of text gets lost off the right side of the screen at 200% zoom, and users could miss the information entirely or may need to scroll horizontally. In this case, use <code>float:left</code> to position your elements and to allow the column that gets lost to move below the other content as text size increases or as the window width decreases.</li>
          <li>If the space between elements or the page margin increase too much as text size increases, set the size of that spacing using fixed measures, rather than using ems or percent.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>If you find that elements overlap when the text is resized, the following adjustments often help: </p>
        <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
          <li>positioning elements using percent or ems, so their distance from other objects increases as the text-size increases</li>
          <li>specifying the <code>width</code> and/or <code>height</code> of boxes that hold text using percent or ems, so that the width and/or height expands as text-size increases</li>
          <li>setting the CSS <code>overflow</code> property to <code>auto</code> for boxes that hold text, so that text remains in the box and scroll bars appear when needed.</li>
          <li>using the CSS <code>float</code> property, to position elements on the page, so they can reflow as their size increases.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Responsive Design</h3>
        <p>On mobile browsers, there are multiple ways to magnify the text on the screen:</p>
        <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
          <li>Set default text size of text rendered in the browser - ensure that content and functionality is not unavailable or clipped.</li>
          <li>Magnify browser's viewport (typically "pinch-zoom") - if the viewport settings are defined, ensure that viewport meta tag is set to user scrollable and maximum scale is at least 2.0 or is not restricted.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Android Applications</h3>
        <p>Android system settings allow users to enlarge text and increase system level zoom. To honor the system font size settings in the application, mark the text and their associated containers to be measured in <a href="https://developer.android.com/guide/practices/screens_support.html#screen-independence">scale pixels</a>.</p>
        <p>When users have large fonts enabled or the labels support internationalization, their type might be larger than the space allotted for the control label. Android Developers Guide provides some design strategies for handling this situation:  <a href="https://developer.android.com/design/style/devices-displays.html">Devices and Displays</a> and <a href="https://developer.android.com/guide/practices/screens_support.html">Supporting Multiple Screens</a>.</p>

        <h3>iOS Applications</h3>
        <p>iOS settings allow user to set the font size and magnify the screen. Support Dynamic Type within the application. Dynamic Type will automatically adjust to letter spacing and line height for every font size, provide the ability to specify different text styles for semantically distinct blocks of text, and the text will responds appropriately to changes the user makes to text-size settings (including accessibility text sizes).</p>
        <p>NOTE: If the application uses a custom font, the text can be scaled according to the system setting for text size programmatically. Ensure that the application responds appropriately when the user changes the setting.To learn how to use text styles and ensure that your app gets notified when the user changes the text size setting, see <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/StringsTextFonts/Conceptual/TextAndWebiPhoneOS/CustomTextProcessing/CustomTextProcessing.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40009542-CH4-SW65">Text Styles</a> in <a style="font-style:italic;" href="https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/StringsTextFonts/Conceptual/TextAndWebiPhoneOS/Introduction/Introduction.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40009542">Text Programming Guide for iOS</a>.</p>
          
        <h3>PDF in Acrobat</h3>
        <p>The text size in a PDF document can be increased using View &gt; Zoom. When the document size is increased, there are often horizontal and vertical scroll bars. Acrobat has a temporary view called Reflow that shows content of the PDF in single column taking the entire width of the document pane. To turn on Reflow, go to View &gt; Zoom &gt; Reflow.</p>
        <p>If the document order in Reflow is not correct, correct it in the Order pane. If an image or other content needs to be viewed in between two paragraphs in Reflow yet one entry in the Order pane covers both paragraphs, you will need to review the order in the Content pane. After making changes, also verify that the content is in the correct order in the Tags pane.</p>

      <h2 id="g23">Guideline 23. Design e-learning so that it does not cause blink, flash or flicker (No blinking/No flickering)</h2>
      <div class="guideline_content">
        <p class="summary">Design e-learning so that it does not cause blink, flash or flicker.</p>
        
        <p>Notes: </p>
        <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
          <li>This includes text and animations that do not move smoothly, creating a flickering effect.</li>
          <li>If blinking, flashing or flickering is necessary for pedagogical purposes, and you are a Pearson employee, contact <a href="mailto:accessibility@pearson.com">accessibility@pearson.com</a>.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Rationale</h3>
        <p>Certain types of blinking, flashing and flickering can cause seizures in people with a condition called photosensitive epilepsy. In addition, users who are susceptible to this condition may not be aware of it and so will pay little attention to warning messages that address people with epilepsy.</p>
        <p>The more of the user's field of vision that is taken up with flashing content, the more likely there will be issues. Although some studies have recently be undertaken to try to determine safe levels of flash based on the speed of the flashing, the size of the area affected, and the colors/brightness involved, details of flashing in Web media (speed, size &amp; color) can vary from system to system and user agent to user agent and so cannot be guaranteed. </p>
        <p>In addition, blinking, flashing and flickering content can be distracting to most users and especially users with learning disabilities and attention deficit disorders. If such content is presented along side text, for example, users may have difficulty to concentrating on reading the text.</p>
        
        <h3>HTML</h3>
        <ol class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--ordered">
          <li>Do not use the <code>&lt;blink&gt;</code> tag. (It is non-standard HTML.) </li>
          <li>Do not use the <code>&lt;marquee&gt;</code> tag. (It is non-standard HTML and it causes flicker effects while a user focuses on the text trying to read it.)</li>
          <li>Do not use animations that blink or flicker.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>JavaScript and Applications</h3>
        <h4>Intentional Flicker or Choppy Animations</h4>
        <p>Don't create animation that blinks or flickers.</p>
        
        <h4>Accidental Flicker</h4> 
        <p>If code that changes the display runs in a loop or may run for a series of user actions, consider whether it depends on accompanying conditions to avoid blinking. For example, code that switches images might depend on the presence of a particular backdrop to avoid blinking. If so, make sure the code will not run without the condition needed to avoid blinking.</p>
        
        <h4>Accidental Flicker onLoad</h4>
        <p>If a page layout is made up of many elements layered on top of each other as shown below, it is important to ensure that slow loading won't cause blinking.<br>
          <img src="images/layout.fw.png" width="179" height="122" alt="A page layout has a black border around a white frame that holds two dark grey regions, one of which contains two light grey regions."></p>
        <p>If you use code to place each box in the design, the user's screen may go through the following states:<br>
          <img src="images/flash_layout.fw50.fw.png" width="341" height="222" alt="The browser is white, then filled with black, then a large white rectangle fills most of that, then 2 black rectangles fill most of the white rectangle,then two light grey rectangles fill most of one of the black rectangles."></p>
        <p>Depending on the user's load speed, this can create blinking. To avoid or fix this, make all of the elements the same color while they are loading, and only assign their final colors after they are all in place.</p>
        
        <h4>Accidental Flicker Based on User Actions</h4>
        <p>If code that creates one blink or change in color is triggered by user action, consider:</p>
        <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
          <li>Is it possible for user action to create a backlog of these events that will be processed later, creating a flicker effect? If so, design the code so that it will not keep running through those actions to catch up.</li>
          <li>To work efficiently, would the user have to trigger this repeatedly, creating a flashing effect? If so, avoid changes in blocks of color for that activity.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Rationale</h3>
        <p>Moving content can be distracting to most users and especially users with learning disabilities and attention deficit disorders. If the moving content is presented alongside text, for example, users may have difficulty concentrating on the text.</p>
        <p>Five seconds is based on WCAG 2.0 SC 2.2.2.</p>

        <h3>General Techniques</h3>
        <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
          <li>Often the best technique is to present a static page at first, allowing the user start the motion using a play button. In this case, provide a stop button near the play button or use a single play/pause toggle button.</li>
          <li>Provide a button to stop or pause the moving content. And, ideally, also code the escape key to stop the movement so that users can quickly stop the motion from anywhere on the page. This escape key functionality is particularly helpful for keyboard access users and for those who use high levels of magnification, which might make it difficult to find the stop or pause button.</li>
          <li>If the moving content is decorative, you might provide a button to hide the moving content. Again, consider allowing the escape key to stop/hide all motion on the page.</li>
          <li>If the moving content is decorative and it is on its own page, the ability to close the window is a sufficient way to stop the motion.</li>
          <li>OR verify that the user agent (e.g. browser, Flash player, PDF reader) provides an accessible way to stop the motion. (See Technology Specifics.)</li>
        </ul>
      
        <h3>HTML &amp; JavaScript</h3>
        <h4>Animated Gif / Animated PNG</h4>
        <p>If your supported browsers provide the ability to stop animations, this browser feature can usually be used to satisfy this requirement:</p>
        <table class="pe-table">
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th scope="col"></th>

              <td>Escape Key or Stop Button</td>
              <td>Not animated</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <th scope="row">IE 8 (Windows 7)</th>
              <td>Escape Key or Stop Button</td>
              <td>Not animated</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <th scope="row">Safari 4 (Windows XP or 7)</th>
              <td>No known solution</td>
              <td>Not animated</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <th scope="row">Google Chrome 4 (Windows 7)</th>
              <td>No known solution</td>
              <td>Not animated</td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>
        <p>However, if there are multiple animations on the page and at least one provides information, you will need to use a technique like the JavaScript techniques below to allow users to play the animations one-by-one, focusing on each animation individually.</p>
        
        <h4>Using JavaScript to Hide Decorative Animations</h4>
        <p>The following example script can be used to hide any moving content that is provided through an HTML element:</p>
        <pre><code>//script function to hide motion
function hideMotion(currM) {
  if (document.getElementById) {
    currMStyle = document.getElementById(currM).style;
    currMStyle.display = "none";
  }
}</code></pre>
        <pre><code>&lt;!-- HTML to set up to use function to hide motion --&gt;
&lt;div id="animation"&gt;Any type of moving  content here.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;a href="javascript:hideMotion('animation');"&gt;Hide Animation &lt;/a&gt;</code></pre>
        <p>You might also replace the animation with a static image, or position a static image behind the animation so that it appears when the animation is hidden.</p>
        <p>Many media players and plugins will allow you to create links that manipulate the embedded media through JavaScript.</p>

        <h3>Flash &amp; Flex</h3>
        <p>The Flash Player's default (keyboard inaccessible) context menu contains "next," "previous," "rewind," and "play" options. If "next" or "previous" is chosen, the Flash movie will go to the next or previous frame and stop there. Although it's not the intention of these features, they can be used by the end user to stop motion in Flash content. Since both Flex and later versions of Flash hide these context menu items, they must be enabled by the developer. The snippet below shows how to do this in ActionScript 3:</p>
        <pre><code>
protected function application1_addedToStageHandler(event:Event):void {
  this.contextMenu.builtInItems.forwardAndBack = true;
}</code></pre>
        <p>Since this solution is not keyboard accessible, an additional solution for stopping motion has to be manually implemented by the developer. The section below describes a possible approach to stopping the motion and shows how this single approach can be used in three different ways.</p>
        
        <h4>Stopping MovieClips</h4>
        <p>Animations in Flash content are generally created through movie clip instances. The MovieClip class has a <code>stop()</code> method that can be called to pause the animation. If the movie clip contains nested animated movie clips then the <code>stop()</code> method will have to be called for those child clips as well. The snippet below shows a "stopOrPlayAll" method that achieves this by recursively stopping or restarting a MovieClip instance and all its child movie clips.</p>
        <pre><code>
function stopOrPlayAll(content:DisplayObjectContainer,
                       startIt:Boolean = false):void {
  if (content is MovieClip) {
    (content as MovieClip)[startIt ? "play" : "stop"]();
  }
  if (content.numChildren) {
    var child:DisplayObjectContainer;
    for (var i:int, n:int = content.numChildren; i &lt; n; ++i) {
      if (content.getChildAt(i) is DisplayObjectContainer) {
        child = content.getChildAt(i) as DisplayObjectContainer;
        if (child.numChildren) stopOrPlayAll(child, startIt);
        else if (child is MovieClip) (child as MovieClip)[startIt ? "play" : "stop"]();
      }
    }
  }
}</code></pre>
        <p>This method can then be used in different ways. For example, it can be called a few seconds after the Flash movie loads:</p>
        <pre><code>
setTimeout(function() {
  stopOrPlayAll(smiley, false);
  pauseBtn.selected = false;
}, 5000);</code></pre>
        <p><img src="images/toggle_animation.jpg" width="128" height="124" alt=""><br>
          Or it can be called when the user requests it. The snippet below shows how to a toggle button can be used to stop and restart an animation:</p>
        <pre><code>
import fl.accessibility.ButtonAccImpl;
import fl.controls.Button;
import flash.events.MouseEvent;

ButtonAccImpl.enableAccessibility();
var pBtn:Button;
pBtn.addEventListener(MouseEvent.CLICK,
                      function(event:MouseEvent):void {
  stopOrPlayAll(smiley, Button(event.target).selected);
});</code></pre>
        <p>Alternatively, a global keyboard shortcut can be used to pause or toggle the animation. See the Flash &amp; Flex techniques for Pearson Guideline 34 for more information about how to create global keyboard shortcuts that are also available when the Flash movie does not have keyboard focus.</p>

In <a href="#g25">Pearson Guideline 25</a> we make sure those who consume the content more slowly will be able to step through any important content.</p>
         
        <h3>Rationale</h3>
        <p>People with disabilities such as dyslexia or low vision can have trouble reading moving text. Making sure that people can read the text while it is still allows them to read at their own pace and without the added complexity of movement.</p>
        <p>Also, expecially in Flash and Flex, text that appears only for a short time can be troublesome for screen reader users, as the text may be replaced before it has been fully spoken.</p>
        
        <h3>General Techniques</h3>
        <ol class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--ordered">
          <li><p>Have text, equations &amp; diagrams settle and become still after no more than five seconds of motion. (Five seconds was chosen based on WCAG 2.0 SC 2.2.2.)</p>

        <h3>Technology Specifics</h3>
        <h4>Legacy HTML</h4>
        <p>Do not use the <code>&lt;marquee&gt;</code> tag. (It is non-standard HTML and it causes flicker effects while a user focuses on the text to read it.)</p>
         
        <h3>PowerPoint</h3>
        <p>Automatically timed animations and automatic slide advance can present problems for users who need more time to read the screen and for those using assistive devices. Animation sequences usually introduce new content to the page. If the content changes before the user is ready, they will miss it. Also, screen readers can have trouble reading the correct page element at the correct time.</p>
        <p>Avoid automatically timed animations and automatic slide advance where content needs to be read. Change the animations to be activated on mouse click. Animations triggered by mouse clicks can be controlled by the user during a slideshow with both a mouse and keyboard.</p>

        <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
          <li>This guideline applies to both encoded text and images of text.</li>
          <li>This guideline does NOT apply to:
              <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
                <li>Logos</li>
                <li>Images that are for decoration only</li>

              </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Rationale</h3>
        <p>The contrast ratios for small and large text are from <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/visual-audio-contrast-contrast.html">W3C's Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0</a>. They are based on research designed to create a measurable definition of sufficient contrast. The <a href="https://www.section508.va.gov/support/webdev/7_3.asp">508 Refresh</a> will likely use the same measurements.</p>
        <p>There are a number of free tools that use the WCAG 2.0 algorithm to test contrast. For example, the <a href="https://developer.paciellogroup.com/resources/contrastanalyser/">Paciello Group's Contrast Analyser</a> is used in the examples presented in the General Techniques for this PG.</p>
        <p>Meeting these contrast ratios avoids cases where text is difficult to read due to insufficient contrast. This is important for users with common minor visual acuity issues.</p>
        <p>The contrast tests are also important for users with color blindness. The WCAG 2.0 algorithm calculates brightness without consideration of color. For example, red and green of exactly the same brightness, would have a 1:1 ratio, which is the same ratio a color would have with itself. So, for the most part, when you test for contrast, you are also testing to ensure that people with color blindness can read the text.</p>
        <p>Because of the biology of color blindness, however, red often appears darker to people with color blindness than it does to people without color blindness. This is the reason for the increased level of contrast when comparing red (or nearly red) and black (or nearly black).</p>
        <p>Added Benefits:</p>
        <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
          <li>The 3:1 ratio is the International Standards Organization (ISO) and American National Standard Institute (ANSI) requirement for minimum contrast for users with <strong>standard vision</strong> using a computer monitor. As such, following <a href="#g26">PG 26</a> ensures that we meet this basic need for all users.</li>
          <li><a href="#g26">PG 26</a> requires an enhanced contrast ratio for small text and this helps users who may be viewing the content in less-than-ideal lighting conditions (e.g. mobile device screen in sunlight).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Techniques</h3>
        <ol class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--ordered">
          <li>Use a Contrast Analyzer that supports the WCAG 2.0 Contrast Ratio Algorithm while selecting foreground and background colors for text. A number of these tools are available. Contrast Analyser from the Paciello Group is available for free and is used for the examples in these guidelines: <a href="http://www.paciellogroup.com/resources/contrast-analyser.html">http://www.paciellogroup.com/resources/contrast-analyser.html</a> (Mac &amp; Windows)</li>
          <li>Avoid placing text over complex backgrounds. One way to avoid this is to provide an outline or shading around the letters. This way, the outline or the shading becomes the background.</li>
          <li><p>If you have text over an image, pattern or gradient, make sure the contrast is sufficient between the text and the area of the background that provides the least contrast with the text color. For example, the yellow text in the image below sits over a few shades of red. Since the least contrast exists between the yellow text and the lighter shade of red, you would use the lighter shade when testing the contrast:<br>
              <img src="images/contrast_exterior.png" width="400" height="233" alt="In Contrast Analyser, a box surrounds a pixel just above the text, where the red gradient that comes in contact with the text is lightest."></p>
          </li>
          <li><p>When selecting the text color for anti-aliased text, choose a center-most pixel that reflects the perceived color of the text:<br>
              <img src="images/contrast_interior.png" width="400" height="233" alt="In Contrast Analyser, a box surrounds a pixel in the middle of a letter, where anti-aliasing has not begun to blend the text color with the background color."></p>
            </li>
          <li>If the text does not have enough contrast with the background, the pull-down menu next to the color in Contrast Analyser will provide some suggested similar colors. For a finer level of control, go to Options &gt; Show color sliders, where you can adjust the colors bit by bit until you find a combination that meets that requirements.</li>
          <li><p>Most often the technique just mentioned will yield a color combination very similar to your original design. Occasionally, though, as with white text on a yellow background, there is no color combination that has a similar appearance. In this case, you can provide shading just under the text to achieve the necessary contrast, while maintaining the intended color scheme:</p>
              <p><strong>Before:</strong><br>
                <img src="images/log_in_fff.gif" width="49" height="22" alt="White text on a yellow background."></p>
              <p><strong>After:</strong><br>
                <img src="images/log_in_fff_AFTER.gif" width="49" height="22" alt="White text with a deep yellow outline on a yellow background."></p>
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Technology Specifics</h3>
        <h4>HTML | XHTML | CSS | JavaScript</h4>
        <ol class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--ordered">
          <li>A common browser feature allows users to set their preferred colors for any colors that were not set by the browser. If you set only the foreground color or only the background color, the color might be paired with a color that provides little or no contrast. So, set both foreground or background color, or set neither. (Don't forget links and visited links.)</li>
          <li><p>When the default design does not have enough contrast and when modifying the default design is problematic, you can meet the requirement by creating an alternate style sheet.</p>
            <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
              <li><strong>7:1 Contrast:</strong> The new Section 508 guidelines may (once finalized) require 7:1 contrast where optional views are provided. So, provide at least one style sheet where the contrast is at least 7:1 for all text.</li>
              <li><strong>Example code for adding alternate style sheets:</strong>
                <pre><code>
&lt;!-- settings from this file are common to all views:
link does not have a title and rel is "stylesheet" --&gt;
&lt;link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="persistent.css" /&gt;
&lt;!-- default view: link has a title and rel is "stylesheet" --&gt;
&lt;link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="base.css" title="Default Colors" /&gt;
&lt;!-- optional view: link has a title and rel is "alternate stylesheet"--&gt;
&lt;link rel="alternate stylesheet" type="text/css" href="high_contrast.css" title="High Contrast" /&gt;</code></pre>
                <p>The values of the title attributes will appear in menus provided by standards-compliant browsers:*image*</p>
              </li>
              <li><p><strong>UI Controls for Choosing the Alternate Style Sheet:</strong> Provide a UI control and script that allows the user to select a style sheet. The control itself must meet contrast requirements. The following article describes how this is done and provides a script that accomplishes this without interfering with browser-based style sheet menus: <a href="https://alistapart.com/article/alternate/">www.alistapart.com/stories/alternate/</a></p>
                <p>As described, use a cookie, so that the user's choice of style sheet persists from page to page. (Browser menus alone generally do not remember the user's choice from page to page.)</p>
              </li>
            </ul> 
          </li>
          <li><strong>Images of text:</strong> A site may have images of text that are not placed through the style sheets. If such images don’t meet the contrast requirements, an alternate style sheet alone will not fully satisfy this PG. The images of text still would not have enough contrast. In this case, use JavaScript to replace the images with high contrast images or with text. A single control should then be provided to trigger the JavaScript that swaps the style sheet as well as the JavaScript that swaps the images.</li>

      <h2 id="g27">Guideline 27. Don't Rely on Color Coding</h2>
      <div class="guideline_content">
        <p class="summary">When color is used to provide information, also provide the information through another <span class="with-color">visual</span> method.</p>
         
        <h3>Rationale</h3>
        <p>People with color blindness can have difficulty distinguishing between colors, particularly red/green, red/black and green/blue. In addition people with visual impairment often experience difficulty with color perception. So, if color is used to provide information, the information should also be provided in another way for these visual users. </p>
        <p>Also, even a user who has no color vision issues might turn off style sheets, use their own style sheet, or select custom colors. If you've provided information by color coding text, for example, the information may be lost with these customizations. </p>
        <p>PGs 27 – 29 discuss ways to make visual content available to those who cannot see it. Many of these techniques involve providing content that is hidden to most users, and revealed only through assistive technologies, like screen readers. </p>
        <p>When providing alternate content for color though, the content must be available to users without assistive technology. For example, if a red check mark and a green check mark are used to indicate correct and incorrect answers, hidden alt-text for the check mark images is not sufficient for <a href="#g27">PG 27</a>. Using a red x and a green check mark would satisfy <a href="#g27">PG 27</a>, as the variation in shape is a supplemental visual indicator. (And, as described in <a href="#g29">PG 29</a>, with alt-text for the images, the information is also available to screen readers.)</p>

        <h3>Techniques</h3>
        <h4>Text Labels</h4>
        <p>When you use color coding, the simplest solution is to provide text labels in addition to color. For example, in the screen capture below, the quiz results are expressed visually by rectangles, which are labeled with both color coding and text labels.<br>
          <img src="images/newresults.gif" width="321" height="126" alt="Quiz results with a green bar representing percent correct and a red bar representing percent incorrect. The bars are labeled with the words 'correct' and 'incorrect'."></p>
        <p>The words correct and incorrect label each rectangle so that users who are color blind can still understand the graphics. The image below shows the same screen capture as it would be seen by a user with the most common form of color blindness, Deuteranopia:<br>
          <img src="images/newresults_Deuteranope.jpg" width="321" height="126" alt="Percent correct and incorrect are both represented by dark brown bars. But, since they are labeled, it is clear which is which."></p>
        
        <h4>Lead Lines</h4>
        <p>For maps and diagrams, lead lines to associate labels with sections of the image can be helpful.<br>
          <img src="images/lead_lines.png" width="454" height="255" alt="In this building map, labels are placed outside the map, but near what they label. Short black lines lead from the label to the corresponding section of the map."></p>
        
        <h4>Patterns and Symbols</h4>
        <p>Another method is to supplement color with other visual elements such as patterned fills, varying line styles or even symbols added to shaded areas.<br>
          <img src="images/patterns.fw.png" width="368" height="355" alt="One area of a floor plan is red with white dots, another is blue with a large letter S in the center. A key maps the first to 'High Radiation - Wear Protective Gear' and the second to 'Sound Sensitive Equipment - Shut Down Click-to-Speak Devices'."></p>
        
        <p>To keep use of patterns from creating overly busy graphs you can:</p>
        <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
          <li>Label a section with one letter or just one shape instead of a pattern</li>
          <li>Instead of using equally busy patterns for each section of a graph, start solid and add pattern elements, so that the patterns get busier or less busy with the trend, or along an axis. For example, if one section of a chart is filled with 20 tiny diamonds, the next may have only 10 tiny diamonds spaced further apart, the next may have only 5 tiny diamonds spread even further apart, and the last may have no pattern at all.</li>
          <li>Highlight just one section of a graph with pattern</li>
          <li>Change the size of pattern elements. For example, if one section of a chart is filled with 20 tiny diamonds, use 7 larger diamonds for the next section, and 3 even larger diamonds for the next.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4>Tip: But Please Keep the Colors!</h4>
        <p>Do not remove color to meet accessibility requirements, as color is helpful to many users, including those with cognitive impairments. In general, accessibility requirements are best met by enriching content with multiple means of rendering information, rather than by removing features.</p>

      <h2 id="g28">Guideline 28. Have sufficient color contrast in key images (Color Contrast in Key Images)</h2>
      <div class="guideline_content">
        <p class="summary">Design graphics so that <span class="with-color">pertinent</span> content will not be lost from lack of contrast when viewed with common variations in color-vision (color-blindness).</p>
        <p>Note: Following <a href="#g26">Pearson Guideline 26</a>, which is for all visual readers, also ensures that images of text will be readable for users who are color blind.</p>

        <h3>Rationale</h3>
        <p>This guideline focuses on cases where an image is not necessarily color-coded, but users with color blindness encounter issues because colors that appear distinct to the average user appear the same to them. This can cause some of the information to disappear or be difficult to see for users with color blindness. </p>
        <p>For example, in the following graphic three lines are displayed in different colors and different line styles. So, the information is not conveyed by color alone. However, there is not enough contrast between the red line and the green background for a person with a type of red-green color blindness called Protanopia. As such, the red line disappears as it enters the Protanopia simulation provided the Paciello Group's Color Contrast Analyser Screen Convert feature:<br>
          <img src="images/img_contr.png" width="459" height="197" alt="Three lines represent sales on a line graph. A color vision simulator causes the red line to disappear."></p>
        <p><mark>(If you have Protanopia color vision, click here to see the example in a new window.)</mark></p>
        <p>Similarly, if there is an image of a fruit market and the number of types of fruit is significant to the learning module, it is a problem if the avocados and the red pears are distinct to the average user, but look the same to a user with color blindness.</p>

        <h3>General Techniques</h3>
        <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
          <li><p><strong>Pertinent content only:</strong> Details of images only have contrast requirements if they provide pertinent information. So, for example, in the navigation menu shown below, the Index icon has some very subtle lines that represent text on the document. Some users will not see these lines. However, since these icons supplement text, the icons are not important for understanding the menu items. As such, there are no contrast requirements for these decorative icon images:</p>
            <img src="images/low_contrast_ok.png" width="231" height="141" alt="Navigation bar with small decorative icons"></li>
          <li><p><strong>Designing graphics:</strong> When designing graphics, you can use the methods described below to test the graphics as you design them. However, particularly if your graphic requires several overlapping colors, it can be easier to choose a color scheme upfront that will be effective for people with color blindness. Cynthia Brewer's (Penn State) Brewer Color palette can help with this:</p>

            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><p>Testing simple line drawings: If you are working on a line drawing that uses just a few colors on a solid background, you can use the techniques for testing text as described in <a href="#g26">PG 26</a>:</p>

          </li>
          <li><p><strong>Testing graphics:</strong> When more complex graphics provide information or have details that are significant to the content of a learning module, use a simulator for color blindness to see if any important information is lost when viewed with different types of color vision:</p>

          </li>
          <li><p><strong>Correcting graphics:</strong> If any important information does become obscured:</p>
            <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
              <li>Modify the image to use different colors or patterns or so that shape, pattern or texture can be seen and used to make important distinctions when color is not available. For example, a larger image or closer view of the fruit market described above might make the avocados and the pears distinguishable without color.</li>
              <li>Provide a link near the image to a version adjusted for color blind users. You can use <a href="http://www.vischeck.com/daltonize/runDaltonize.php">Daltonization</a> to produce such an image quickly.</li>
              <li>Add a visible caption under the image that provides any information that is not available without color. This is useful in cases where you do not own the permissions needed to generate derivative versions of an image.</li>

        <p class="summary">If an image provides information, provide the same information in a text alternative.</p>
        <p>Notes: </p>
        <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
          <li>This includes videos and animations that are silent or are accompanied by sounds that do not provide information, such as background music.</li>
          <li>For some images, supplemental tactile-ready image files can also be helpful.</li>
        </ul>
             
        <h3>Rationale</h3>
        <p>This allows screen reader users to access the information provided by the image. It also helps when users have images turned off or unavailable as in mobile browsing.</p>
        
        <h3>General Techniques</h3>
        <h4>What to Write</h4>
        <p>When writing text alternatives first determine the purpose of the image:</p>
        <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
          <li>If the image is used to label a control, see <a href="#g30">PG 30</a>.</li>
          <li>If the image is decorative or used for spacing, see <a href="#g38">PG 38</a>.</li>
          <li>If the image is used to show what something looks like, such as a picture of a particular type of cloud, the alt-text should describe key aspects of the appearance of the cloud, as needed to provide the information that image is intended to provide.</li>
          <li>For images that provide data or illustrate a point, the alt-text should not describe the image, but should provide the same data or illustrate the same point.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For example, assume the graph below is part of a report on the pros and cons of a park renovation project. In that case, the alt-text shown below would <strong>not</strong> be correct for the graph, as the information provided by the graph is missing:<br>
        <img src="images/dogs_in_park.png" width="294" height="203" alt="image accurately described in both the incorrect and correct alt-text examples below."></p>
        <pre class="incorrect"><code>Incorrect alt-text: Two slightly three dimensional silver rectangles with some numbered blue dotted lines show how many dogs were in the park on Saturday and Sunday.</code></pre>
        <p>The alt-text shown below, though, is appropriate as the description provides the information conveyed through the graph:</p>
        <pre><code>Correct alt-text: A graph shows that nearly twice as many dogs were in the park on Saturday compared to Sunday, with 31 on Saturday and 17 on Sunday.</code></pre>
        <p>Text alternatives should include not just the data presented by an image, but also any comparisons or statistical trends that the visuals make immediately apparent. For example, the "Correct alt-text" example above provides the following three key pieces of information:</p>
        <ol class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--ordered">
          <li>The topic of the graph (the number of dogs in the park)</li>
          <li>The relationships that are seen visually ("nearly twice as many")</li>
          <li>The data provided by the graph ("31 on Saturday and 17 on Sunday")</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Note: Context matters. For example, the "incorrect alt-text" above might be appropriate if the graph were included in a discussion on the appearance of graphs.

        <h4>Tips for Writing Good Alternative Text for Complex Images</h4>
        <h5>Staying on Task</h5>
        <ol class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--ordered">
          <li>Write text alternatives that serve the same purpose as the image, do not just label the image.</li>
          <li>Do not use alt-text to provide new information that is not in the image.</li>
          <li>Do not write text alternatives for images that are merely decorative. (See <a href="#g38">Pearson Guideline 38</a>)</li>
          <li>Do not provide more than brief labels for images that only repeat information that is already present in the text.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h4>Effective Descriptions</h4>
        <ol class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--ordered">
          <li>Understand the context.</li>
          <li>Keep it concise.</li>
          <li>Start general and move to specifics.</li>
          <li>Use polished and grammatically correct language.</li>
          <li>If the image is of a particularly obvious or unique type, consider identifying the type of image (e.g. cartoon, photo).</li>
          <li>Pay Attention to New Items vs. Items Already Mentioned (i.e. a triangle vs. the triangle).</li>
          <li>Check your work, by imagining your text in use. Does it serve the same purpose as the image?</li>
          <li>Especially when describing how something looks, consider asking others to read your description to see if they agree with any poetic interpretations.</li>
          <li>Does the image suggest any of the structures available in structured text? Use headings, bulleted lists, numbered lists, definition lists, nested lists and tables to organize long or complex text alternatives. For flow charts and similar in HTML, use aria-flowto.</li>
          <li>Avoid excess repeated noise in lists of items. For example, instead of starting each list item with "cats that," place that text in front of the list.</li>
          <li>Double check that the data in the text alternative is the same as the data in the original image.</li>
          <li>Always use the same terminology and reading level that is used in the main text.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Images in HTML, CSS, &amp; JavaScript</h3>
        <h4>HTML | XHTML</h4>
        <ol class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--ordered">
          <li>If the image is used to display text, see PG 21 to determine if you should use encoded text instead. If you decide to keep the text as an image, the alt-text should be the text that appears on the image. The same image may also contain non-text graphics that provide information. In that case, the alt-text should include that information as well.</li>
          <li><p><strong>Writing Short &amp; Long Text Alternatives:</strong></p>
            <p>HTML and XHTML allow two types of text alternatives, regular alt-text and long descriptions. The alt-text will be read automatically while the document is being read. In cases where long description text is needed, a link out to long description text will be provided. This allows screen reader users with visual impairment to decide when and if they wish to delve into the details of the image, much as a sighted user might glance at the image when they first reach it, but decide to analyze it in detail later.</p>
            <p>So, note how many words the text alternative for an image will require. When working with an image that contains text, do not count the words in the alt-text that exactly mirror the text in the image. (There's no need to for a separate long description if the image is really a paragraph of text meant to be read with the rest of the page, for example.)</p>
            <p><mark>This free script is provided by <a href="http://javascriptkit.com/">JavaScript Kit</a></mark></p>
            <p>If the word count is more than about 30 words, prepare two text alternatives:</p>
            <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
              <li>An overview of the information conveyed by the image - This should be plain text. (This will be referred to as alt-text throughout this document.)</li>
              <li>A full portrayal of the information conveyed by the image - Use the same type of formatting for this text that you would use for any text in the media. (This will be referred to as long description text throughout this document.)</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>When the text alternative can be about 30 words or fewer use only the <code>alt</code> attribute and simply do not include the <code>longdesc</code> attribute:
            <pre><code>&lt;img src="filename.gif"       alt="About 30 words or fewer"&gt;</code></pre>
          </li>
          <li><p>If the text alternative must be longer than about 30 words, use the alt attribute to provide an overview of the information conveyed by the image. And, place a full text alternative in a separate HTML file, which should be written in accessible HTML. Associate the separate HTML file with the image using the longdesc attribute:</p>
            <pre><code>
&lt;img src="filename.gif" alt="About 30 words or fewer" longdesc="filename-LD.html"&gt;</code></pre>
            <p>Note: There is a bug in JAWS which prevents the <code>longdesc</code> attribute from working when the URL begins with a forward slash  referring to the document root. This has been reported to Freedom Scientific. If you only have a URL that begins at the document root, you can use an off-screen link with link text "long description" instead of using the <code>longdesc</code> attribute.</p>
          </li>
          <li><p>When an image is used as an image map, the alt attribute for the image will be supplemented by alt attributes for the image map's <code>area</code> elements. So, the alt-text for the image should provide any information that is not conveyed through the altattributes for the image map's <code>area</code> elements. If no additional information is conveyed, use <code>alt=""</code>.</p>
            <pre><code>
&lt;img src="states.gif" alt="Choose a state" usemap="states"&gt;</code></pre>
            <pre><code>
&lt;img src="menu.gif" alt="" usemap="5_links"&gt;</code></pre>
            <p>(See <a href="#g30">PG 30</a> for information on adding alt-text for the <code>area</code> elements.)</p>
          </li>
          <li><p>When you link directly to an image file instead of linking to an HTML page that contains an img element, you lose the opportunity to add text alternatives in the standard manner. So, either:</p>
              <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
                  <li><p>Link to an HTML page that contains the image, instead of linking directly to the image file.</p>
                    <p>OR</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>If the link to the image is actually a smaller version of that image, you can include the alt-text using the image tag of the smaller version. In this case, since screen readers will announce the presence of a link, be sure that the link text (and surrounding context) make it clear that the purpose of the link is merely to enlarge the image. (See <a href="#g16">PG 16</a> for more on link text context.)</li>
              </ul>
          </li>
          <li>The <code>background</code> attribute that is sometimes used with the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> tag to add an image to the page does not provide a way to add alternative text for the image. As such, if a background image is used to convey information, the information should also be provided as text. (This is also true of any legacy non-standard use of the <code>background</code> attribute with other HTML elements, such as the <code>table</code> element.)</li>
        </ol>

        <h4>CSS</h4>
        <ol class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--ordered">
          <li>It has become popular to replace encoded text with background images using CSS. These guidelines do not necessarily recommend or discourage this approach. If you do use such techniques, the text that is replaced is the alt-text and must:
            <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
              <li>Be readable by screen readers</li>
              <li>Appear when CSS is off or unavailable</li>
              <li><p>Appear when images are off or unavailable</p>
                <p>AND</p>
              </li>
              <li>Not disrupt the layout when the text size is increased to 200% (see <a href="#g22">PG 22</a> for more on text size requirements)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The success or failure of the technique is in how you hide the text:</p>
            <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
              <li>Do not hide it using <code>display:none</code> or <code>visibility:hidden</code>. Screen readers won't read it. </li>
              <li>Do not hide the text by placing it off-screen. It won't appear when images are not available.</li>
              <li><p>Since we want the encoded text to appear whenever background images are not available, use background images to hide the text. This way, if the background images are removed for any reason, the text will appear right on cue. To do this, place a div behind the text. Size the div using ems to be sure it will increase as text size increases. Give the div a background image that is the same color as the text. But, also give the div a background color that would make the text visible. This hides the text ONLY when background images are present:</p>
                <pre><code>
div.hide_replaced_text {
/* When background images are available,
   the text is white on white. When background
   images are not available the text is white
   on black  */
  color: #FFFFFF;
  background: #000000 url(white.gif) repeat;
}</code></pre>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>For additional information on images introduced through CSS files, see <a href="#g13">PG 13</a>.</li>
        </ol>

        <h4>JavaScript</h4>
        <p>See <a href="#g30">Pearson Guideline 30</a>.</p>
         
        <h3>Object, Embed, Noscript</h3>
        <p>Unlike the case with HTML 5 <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> elements, the fallback content that appears inside <code>&lt;object&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;embed&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;noscript&gt;</code> tags is only served when the browser does not have the ability to present the content.</p>
        <p>Because of this, the default media provided by <code>&lt;object&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;embed&gt;</code> tags is almost always what is served to screen readers, and the fall-back content from object/embed is not served.</p>
        <p>Similarly, the information is inside a <code>&lt;noscript&gt;</code> tag is only served when JavaScript is not available. Screen reader users are likely to have scripting on, and, in this case, the browser would not serve content inside <code>&lt;noscript&gt;</code> tags to screen readers.</p>
        <p>So, there are two choices:</p>
        <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
          <li>Make the default media accessible (See sections of the Pearson Guidelines that apply to the technology in question.)</li>
          <li>Explicitly hide the default media from screen readers and provide an equivalent hidden offscreen (See <a href="#g32">Pearson Guidelines 32</a> and <a href="#g33">33</a> for techniques to use to hide media from screen readers.)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The following CSS can be used to place hidden alternatives on the page. Anything hidden this way will be available to screen readers and will be available when CSS is turned off. In some cases, it will appear for users of custom style sheets.</p>
        <pre><code>
.screen_readers_only {
  position: absolute;
  left: -999px;
  top: auto;
  width: 1px;
  height: 1px;
  overflow: hidden;
}</code></pre>
         
        <h3>Canvas in HTML 5</h3>
        <p>Unlike the case with <code>&lt;object&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;embed&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;noscript&gt;</code> tags, the fallback content that appears between open and close <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> tags is available to both screen reader users and keyboard access users.</p>
        <p>This makes it easy to add alternatives for images that are drawn to the page using <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code>. There are no length restrictions for this fallback content and you have the full power of semantic markup to use to structure the alternative content.</p>
        <p>When <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> is interactive, you can even include interactive elements in the fallback content. The important challenge to remember in this case is that some people will be seeing the canvas while interacting with the fallback content. This includes keyboard access users with average vision and also those with low vision who might be using a combination of magnification and screen reader speech. JavaScript should be used to ensure that the experience for these users matches up. For example, when a button in the fallback content is in focus, you might show a focus indicator around the corresponding element on the canvas.</p>
        
        <h4>Supporting Safari &amp; VoiceOver</h4>
        <p>Safari does not yet support the fallback content. So, conditionally for Safari, place the fallback content in a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> just after the closing tag, have this <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> styled offscreen:</p>
        <pre><code>
.screen_readers_only {
  position: absolute;
  left: -999px;
  top: auto;
  width: 1px;
  height: 1px;
  overflow: hidden;
}</code></pre>

        <p>Images that provide information must have a text alternative. Use the <code>android:contentDescription</code> property to define the text alternative.</p>
        
        <h3>iOS Applications</h3>
        <p>Images that provide information must have a text alternative. When the text alternative can be about 30 words or fewer, use the <code>accessibilityLabel</code> attribute to define the text alternative. If more than 30 words is needed, use the <code>accessibilityHint</code> attribute along with the <code>accessibilityLabel</code> attribute to provide full text alternative.</p>

        <h3>PDF in Acrobat</h3>
        <p>Alternative text can be added to images and other elements in the document. Alternative text is text that will be read instead of the text in the tag. There are two ways to add alternative text to images:</p>
        <ol class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--ordered">
          <li><p><strong>Tags tree</strong> – select the <code>&lt;Figure&gt;</code> tag and go to Properties option in the context menu. Fill in the Alternative text field.<br>
            <img src="images/tag-alt-text.jpg" width="385" height="388" alt=""></p>
          </li>
          <li><p><strong>TouchUp Reading Order (TURO)</strong> – In TURO select the option to show tables and figures. This will list the alternative text for the image. If the image does not have alternative text, it will put "no alternative text exists". To add alternative text, right-click to get to the context menu. Select Edit Alternative Text. Add the alternative text in the dialog window.<br>
            <img src="images/TURO-alt-text.jpg" width="351" height="255" alt=""></p>
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Tips for Alternative Text in Acrobat</h4>
        <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
          <li>The text can be long but consider that the screen reader will read this text to the user. Concise, clear text that describes the concept or action of the picture rather than the visual characteristics of the picture is useful to visually impaired users.</li>
          <li>Alternative text can also be provided for any tag containing text.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Word</h3>
        <p>Images that are part of the content add value to all users and should have alternative text.</p>
        <p>The location to enter the alternative text will vary depending on your version of Word.</p>
        <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
          <li>Word 2003 - Go to Format Picture &gt; Web. Enter the alternative text in the form field.</li>
          <li>Word 2007 - Set the alternative text in the Size properties. Go to Size &gt; Alt Text.</li>
          <li>Word 2010 - Set the alternative text by selecting Format Shape &gt; Alt Text. Enter the alternative text into the description box.</li>
          <li>Word 2013 &amp; Word 2016 - See <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Add-alternative-text-to-a-picture-shape-chart-SmartArt-graphic-or-table-52327e7c-cecb-45d4-9367-f911aa442371?CorrelationId=e35ebb87-d56b-4ee9-9181-527d57d015cb&ui=en-US&rs=en-US&ad=US">Guidance from Microsoft</a>. Use the description field and only add a title if you'd like the image to be labeled with short title instead of your description. In that case, the user will be given the option to access the longer description.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If multiple images are related to represent a single concept, consider grouping them first. The alternative text is should be set on the group object.</p>
        
        <h4>Word Art</h4>
        <p>WordArt is stylized text. In Word 2003 and 2007, it is treated as a picture so you should add alternative text. Word 2010 treats it as text; no alternative text is required.</p>
        
        <h4>SmartArt</h4>
        <p>SmartArt is the collection of diagrams and shapes that Word provides. For most of these, the arrows cannot take alternative text and would therefore be inaccessible. The content holders are text boxes, which screen readers do not read (see <a href="#g4">PG 4</a>). Consider the following options:</p>
        <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
          <li>Describe the meaning of the diagram and the information it conveys in adjacent text of the main content. Do not describe the appearance of the diagram unless it is necessary to understand the meaning.</li>
          <li>Add a caption to the diagram that succinctly to describe the point.</li>
          <li>Group the images and add alternative text. Users can still navigate to components of the group.</li>
          <li>Replace the SmartArt with a picture of it, using the Windows 7 Snipping tool or other screen capture programs.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>PowerPoint</h3>
        <p>Images that are part of the content add value to all users and should have alternative text, captions, or both. If the image simply illustrates steps that have been clearly described in the text, it is redundant and should have no alternative text. If it does not any extra value and is merely decorative (e.g. banners, lines, pictures of people), it should not have alternative text (see <a href="#g32">PG 32</a>: Decorative Images).</p>
        <p>The location to enter the alternative text will vary depending on your version of PowerPoint.</p>
        <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
          <li>PowerPoint 2003 - Go to Format Picture &gt; Web. Enter the alternative text in the form field.</li>

        <h4>WordArt</h4>
        <p>WordArt is stylized text. In PowerPoint 2003 and 2007, it is treated as a picture so you should add alternative text. PowerPoint 2010 treats it as text; no alternative text is required.</p>
        
        <h4>SmartArt</h4>
        <p>SmartArt is the collection of diagrams and shapes that PowerPoint provides. PowerPoint does not read the alternate text for the text boxes and arrows in the diagram, but you can set alternate text for the entire diagram, which is read, by right-clicking on its frame and selecting alt text.</p>
        <p>In some cases, it may be easier to take a picture of the SmartArt diagram and add alternative text.</p>
        
        <h4>Shapes</h4>
        <p>PowerPoint does not read the alternate text for shapes, but it will read text in the shape.</p>
        <p>Consider the following options for diagrams and collections of shapes that are not read properly:</p>
        <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
          <li>Describe the meaning of the diagram and the information it conveys in adjacent text of the main content. Do not describe the appearance of the diagram.</li>
          <li>Add a caption to the diagram that succinctly describes the point.</li>
          <li>Group the images and add alternative text.</li>

        <h3>Related Guidelines</h3>
        <h4>508 Web § 1194.22 (a)</h4>
        <p>A text alternative for every non-text element shall be provided (e.g., via "alt", "longdesc", or in element content).</p>

        <h4>WCAG 2.0 Level A - 1.1.1 Non-text Content</h4>
        <p>All non-text content that is presented to the user has a text alternative that serves the equivalent purpose, except for the situations listed below. </p>
        <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
          <li>Controls, Input: If non-text content is a control or accepts user input, then it has a name that describes its purpose. (Refer to Guideline 4.1 for additional requirements for controls and content that accepts user input.)</li>
          <li>Time-Based Media: If non-text content is time-based media, then text alternatives at least provide descriptive identification of the non-text content. (Refer to Guideline 1.2 for additional requirements for media.)</li>
          <li>Test: If non-text content is a test or exercise that would be invalid if presented in text, then text alternatives at least provide descriptive identification of the non-text content.</li>
          <li>Sensory: If non-text content is primarily intended to create a specific sensory experience, then text alternatives at least provide descriptive identification of the non-text content.</li>
          <li>CAPTCHA: If the purpose non-text content is to confirm that content is being accessed by a person rather than a computer, then text alternatives that identify and describe the purpose of the non-text content are provided, and alternative forms of CAPTCHA using output modes for different types of sensory perception are provided to accommodate different disabilities.</li>
          <li>Decoration, Formatting, Invisible: If non-text content is pure decoration, is used only for visual formatting, or is not presented to users, then it is implemented in a way that it can be ignored by assistive technology.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>WCAG 2.0 Level A - SC 1.2.1 Audio-only and Video-only (Prerecorded)</h4>
        <p>For prerecorded audio-only and prerecorded video-only media, the following are true, except when the audio or video is a media alternative for text and is clearly labeled as such: (Level A) </p>
        <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
          <li>Prerecorded Audio-only: An alternative for time-based media is provided that presents equivalent information for prerecorded audio-only content.</li>

      <div class="guideline_content">
        <p class="summary">If an image represents a control or a link, provide text that can serve the same purpose when images are not available.</p>
        <p>Note: This includes videos and animations that are silent or are accompanied by sounds that do not provide information, such as background music.</p>
         
        <h3>Rationale</h3>
        <p>This allows screen reader users to use the control.</p>
        <p>Additional Benefit: This also helps when users have images turned off or unavailable as in mobile browsing.</p>

        <h3>General Techniques</h3>
        <ol class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--ordered">
          <li><p>For active images the alt-text should be written as link text would be written for a standard link with the same function. The screen capture below shows a Web site where the images have been outlined using the Web Developer Toolbar in Firefox. The house icon and the word "home" are part of a single active image:<br>
              <img src="images/homeimage.png" width="270" height="214" alt="Home link in graphical user interface as described above"></p>
              <p>This image should have "Home" as the alt-text:</p>
              <pre><code>
&lt;a href="home.html"&gt;
  &lt;img src="home.gif" alt="Home" /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;</code></pre>
          </li>
          <li><p>Often on Web pages, we mark a link with both an icon and link text. For example, we might have an icon showing a house, followed by the word "Home".</p>
            <p>If the icon is an active link, it will be announced as a link by screen readers. Because of this, the icon image needs alt-text so that a screen reader user will know the purpose of the link. Unfortunately, this often results in screen reader users hearing every such link twice: once for the icon link and once for the text link. This can become very tedious when navigating repetitive pages with a screen reader.</p>
            <p>The solution is to put the image and the link text in the same link tag. Then the image can be given alt-text of <code>alt=""</code>, called null alt-text. This tells the screen reader not to announce the image.</p>
            <p>With this sample code, the link would be announced just once as "link, Home":</p>
            <pre><code>
&lt;a href="home.html"&gt;
  &lt;img src="home_icon.gif" alt="" /&gt;Home
&lt;/a&gt;</code></pre>
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>HTML &amp; JavaScript</h3>
        <h4>HTML | XHTML | CSS</h4>
        <ol class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--ordered">
          <li><p>The alt attribute should be used to convey the purpose of the link, button or control:</p>
            <pre><code>
&lt;a href="home.html"&gt;
  &lt;img src="home.gif" alt="Home" /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;</code></pre>
            <pre><code>
&lt;input type="image" src="create_account.gif" alt="Create Account"&gt;</code></pre>
          </li>
          <li><p>When making client-side image maps accessible, add <code>alt</code> attributes as follows:</p>
            <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
              <li>Each clickable <code>area</code> element in a client-side image map should have an altattribute that describes the purpose of the <code>area</code> element.</li>
              <li>See <a href="#g29">PG 29</a> for information on alt-text for the image map image itself.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ol>
        
        <h4>JavaScript</h4>
        <p>Sometimes a change in the meaning of an element is communicated by changing an image (e.g. a play button becomes a pause button, an expand button becomes a collapse button). In these cases, be sure to update the alt-text as well. For example, the following code changes both the image file (<code>src</code> attribute) and the value of the <code>alt</code> attribute for an image with id <code>uicontrol1</code>:</p>
        <pre><code>
document.getElementById('uicontrol1').src='minus.gif';
document.getElementById('uicontrol1').alt='Collapse menu';</code></pre>
        <p>. . . </p>
        <pre><code>
&lt;button type="button" onclick="toggleMenu();"&gt;
  &lt;img src="plus.gif" alt="Expand menu" id="uicontrol1" /&gt;
&lt;/button&gt;</code></pre>
         
        <h3>Android Applications</h3>
        <p>Active images must have a text alternative that conveys the purpose of the link, button or control. Use the <code>android:contentDescription</code> property to define the text alternative.</p>

        <h3>iOS Applications</h3>
        <p>Image buttons and links should define the alternative text using the <code>accessibilityLabelproperty</code> and <code>the accessibilityTraits</code> property to define the element’s type, state, or behavior. For example, a login image button would have the <code>accessibilityLabel</code> set to "Login" and would be defined with the Link and Image <code>accessibilityTraits</code>.</p>
        <p>Use the <code>accessibilityHint</code> property to provide supplemental information that provides further instructions of what will happen by performing the action if it will be unclear or confusing.</p>

      <h2 id="g31">Guideline 31. Provide alternatives for video and animation that provide information (Complete Narration or Audio Description)</h2>
      <div class="guideline_content">
        <p class="summary">When multimedia (e.g. video, narrated animation) includes important visual and auditory information, provide spoken description of any significant visual elements that would be missed when listening to the audio alone.</p>
        <p>Notes: </p>
        <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
          <li>If you have an interactive with both important sound and motion, but they are presented separately, with transitions triggered by the user, you can use the simpler accommodations described in <a href="g29">guidelines 29</a> (alternative text) and <a href="#g36">36</a> (captions).</li>
          <li>In cases where the spoken description needed is <strong>not</strong> helpful for all audiences, the additional description should go into a separate audio track or second version of the video.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Rationale</h3>
        <p>People with vision impairment can often follow most of the content of multimedia by listening to the audio. However, when key events and visuals are not apparent through the default sound track, additional information is needed. By adding spoken descriptions that play during the multimedia, we can provide that information at the right moments during the video, making it possible for those with visual impairments to follow the default audio.</p>
        <p>Note: These spoken descriptions of the visual content of multimedia are called audio descriptions, where "audio" refers to the mode of delivery.</p>

        <h3>General Techniques</h3>
        <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
          <li>If the visuals are insignificant, for example, a speaker who does not provide any type of demonstration, there is no need to provide audio description of the visuals.</li>
          <li>If the sounds are insignificant, for example, background music, the media can be treated as a silent animation. See <a href="#g29">PG 29</a>.</li>
          <li><p>Audio description can be:</p>
              <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
                <li>included in a separate audio description track that can be activated or deactivated</li>
                <li><p>provided in a separate copy of the multimedia</p>
                  <p>OR</p>
                </li>
                <li>worked into the default sound track for all users</li>
              </ul>
          </li>
          <li>When possible, provide spoken description of visuals during pauses in the soundtrack. If pauses in the soundtrack are too short or too infrequent, pause the media to insert sufficient description of the visual information.</li>
          <li>It is only necessary to describe those visual elements needed to understand the multimedia through audio alone.</li>
          <li>When providing audio description it can be helpful to have the description label background sounds. For example, although understanding a zoologist's philosophy may not require knowing what animal is behind her, if the animal is growling, people are going to wonder. Try to include the information in a natural way, with other important information, as in, "Professor Smith of the Smith Zoo speaks to a small crowd at the zoo's lion exhibit."</li>

      <div class="guideline_content">
        <p class="summary">Allow screen reading software to ignore features that are purely decorative, including images whose meaning is fully expressed through adjacent text.</p>
        <h3>Rationale</h3>
        <p>When listening to content with a screen reader unnecessary output can quickly degrade the experience, making use of the media tiresome and often also confusing.</p>
        
        <h3>HTML &amp; JavaScript</h3>
        <h4>Legacy HTML</h4>
        <p>If you have a site that uses images for spacing either:Incorrect: When the following code is used, a screen reader will read the word "spacer" aloud:</p>
        <pre><code>
&lt;!-- Do not use if the image is only for visual spacing: --&gt;
&lt;img src="spacer.gif" alt="spacer"&gt;</code></pre>
        <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
          <li><p>Revise the site to use css for spacing</p>
            <p>OR</p>
          </li>
          <li>Give each such image an empty <code>alt</code> attribute of the form, <code>alt=""</code>. Include no spaces or other characters in the value of the <code>alt</code> attribute. This tells screen readers to ignore the image.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4>HTML | XHTML | CSS</h4>
        <h5>Basic Decorative images (that do not provide information) should:</h5>
        <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
          <li>Be background images, or be otherwise added through CSS, OR</li>
          <li><p>Should have empty <code>alt</code> attributes of the form <code>alt=""</code>, with no space between the quotes</p>
            <p>Correct for a decorative image: A screen reader will skip the image:</p>
            <pre><code>&lt;img src="fluffy_cloud.gif" alt=""&gt;</code></pre>
            <p>Incorrect: <code>alt</code> attributes are required for images, and a screen reader may read the file name or other unnecessary information:</p>
            <pre><code>&lt;!-- Incorrect --&gt;    &lt;img src="fluffy_cloud.gif"&gt;</code></pre>
            <p>Incorrect: A screen reader will read the word "fluffy cloud" aloud, which, in this case, is not relevant to the content:</p>
            <pre><code>&lt;!-- Not Recommended --&gt;
&lt;img src="spacer.gif" alt="fluffy cloud"&gt;</code></pre>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h5>Links that have both text and images</h5>
        <p>Often on Web pages, we mark a link with both an icon and link text where both are clickable:<br>
          <img src="images/helpicon.JPG" width="60" height="29" alt="A screen shot shows a link with 'Help' as link text followed by an image of a question mark."></p>
        <p>If the icon is an active link, it will be announced as a link by screen readers. Because of this, the icon image needs alt-text so that a screen reader user will know the purpose of the link. Unfortunately, this often results in screen reader users hearing every such link twice: once for the text link and once for the icon link. This can become very tedious when navigating repetitive pages with a screen reader.</p>
        <p>The solution is to put the image and the link text in the same link tag. Then the image can be given alt-text of <code>alt=""</code>, called null alt-text. This tells the screen reader not to announce the image. With this sample code, the link would be announced just once as "link, Help": </p>
        <pre><code>
&lt;a href="help.html" id="helplink"&gt;
  &lt;img border="0" src="need-help.gif" alt="" /&gt;
  &lt;span id="helplinktext"&gt;Help&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;</code></pre>
        <p>A minor problem remains. Some browsers will underline the image. CSS to set <code>text-decoration</code> to none for the image will not work. To remove the underline from the image, use CSS to assign <code>text-decoration: none</code>; to the link. Then, use CSS to assign <code>text-decoration: underline</code>; to the link text. For the HTML shown just above, the CSS might be as follows:</p>
        <pre><code>#helplink {
  text-decoration: none;
}
#helplinktext {
  text-decoration: underline;
}</code></pre>

        <h5>Images Added Through the CSS "Content:" Property</h5>
        <p>When images or icons are added through <code>content:</code> one of three things happen:</p>
        <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
          <li>VoiceOver, NVDA, and other screen readers read the letter used to represent the icon</li>
          <li>VoiceOver presents the user with an empty element</li>
          <li>VoiceOver indicates that there is a graphic without alt-text.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>To prevent this, make sure the element used to place the image or icon doesn't include any important text, and add <code>aria-hidden="true"</code> to the element.</p>

        <h3>Android Applications</h3>
        <p>Decorative images should be ignored. Set the <code>android:focusable</code> property to <code>false</code>.</p>
 
        <h3>iOS Applications</h3>
        <p>Images that convey no information should be ignored by VoiceOver. To hide these images or set them to be ignored, set the <code>setIsAccessibilityElement</code> property to <code>no</code>.</p>

        <h3>PDF in Acrobat</h3>
        <p>Sometimes there are images on the page that are purely decorative and provide no additional information. These images should be ignored by screen readers. There are two ways to do this in Acrobat 9 Pro:</p>
        <ol class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--ordered">
          <li><p>Open the TouchUp Reading Order (TURO) and select the element (or elements) on the page that you want to be ignored. Select background in the TURO dialog box (or right-click on the selection and select Tag as background).<br>
            <img src="images/TURO-background-image.jpg" width="213" height="416" alt=""></p>
          </li>
          <li><p>In the tag tree, you can set the image to an artifact by opening the context menu and selecting Change Tag to Artifact.<br>
            <img src="images/artifact.jpg" width="251" height="271" alt=""></p>
          </li>
        </ol>
 
        <h3>Word</h3>
        <p>Decorative images have no content and do not add any intrinsic value to the document. As the name suggests, they are for decoration only and therefore should be ignored by screen readers. In Word, leave the alternative text field blank.</p>

        <h3>PowerPoint</h3>
        <p>Decorative images have no content and do not add any intrinsic value to the document. As the name suggests, they are for decoration only and therefore should not have alternative text. In PowerPoint, leave the alternative text field blank. Examples of decorative images include watermarks, background pictures, shading, or patterns, divider lines, borders, and most pictures of people.</p>
         
        <h3>Flash</h3>
        <h4>When the Entire Flash Movie is Decorative</h4>
        <p>Set the entire movie to inaccessible in the accessibility panel in Flash. This ensures that nothing from the Flash movie will be read. However, the browser will not know about this setting, so the Flash movie will be announced by screen readers.</p>
        <p>To completely hide the existence of the Flash from screen readers and to prevent keyboard access to the movie, add <code>&lt;param name="wmode" value="opaque"&gt;</code> inside the object tag and add <code>wmode="opaque"</code> to the embed tag.</p>
        <p>For further reading if you want more detail, see <mark><a href="https://webaim.org/articles/flash#hiding">WebAIM's article on Hiding Unimportant Flash Content. (opens in new window)</a></mark></p>
        
        <h4>When Part of a Flash Movie is Decorative</h4>
        <p>Mark the top-most decorative object as inaccessible in the accessibility panel, or use action script to set the silent property to true.</p>
        
        <h3>Testing HTML</h3>
        <p>HTMLToolsUse the formatting images favelet, which will highlight every small image (less than 10 px in either dimension) and display the alt-text next to the image <strong>if that alt-text is not</strong> <code>alt=""</code>. You may want to disable CSS and then apply the favelet so that results are more easily viewed. Disabling CSS is possible from the View menu in most browsers.OutputThe alert lets you know the number of images lacking alt attributes (errors) and the number you need to check out. Those that need checking out are the ones which have alt-text which is not <code>alt=""</code>; you see, <code>alt=""</code> is assumed to be correct for such a small inactive image. These assumed-to-be-correct images are outlined with a dotted line, and will be silent in a screen reader.AnalysisMake sure developers have not used <code>alt="spacer"</code> or other such encumbering additions on these images. (Larger decorative images would be analyzed with the testing techiques for <a href="#g29">Pearson Guideline 29</a> – Images or Animations that Provide Information.)</p>

      <h2 id="g33">Guideline 33. Keep hidden or dimmed content silent in screen readers (Hidden or Dimmed Content)</h2>
      <div class="guideline_content">
        <p class="summary">Ensure screen readers will ignore content that has been hidden or dimmed as part of the media's functionality if the inclusion of that content would be confusing or misleading.</p>

        <h3>Rationale</h3>
        <p>When items that are supposed to be hidden are read by a screen reader, the media can be confusing and unusable.</p>
        <p>For example, in Flash, developers often hide layers of content behind each other. Buttons might be provided to bring layers to the front on demand. Unless the objects in the hidden layers are also hidden from screen readers, these applications will be inaccessible to screen reader users as items from all of the layers (hidden and visible) will be read intermixed with each other, creating a nonsensical user interface.</p>
        <p>This can also occur in HTML. For example, if options only appear to a visual user after the user has selected particular options, it can be very confusing if all of the options appear for screen reader users.</p>

        <h3>HTML &amp; JavaScript</h3>
        <h4>Content that is Fully Hidden from Everyone</h4>
        <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
          <li><p>Mark content that should be hidden from all users (including screen reader users) with CSS <code>display: none</code>.</p>
            <p>OR</p>
          </li>
          <li><p>When content should be hidden, detach the related nodes from the Document Object Model. If you need to replace the nodes later, keep a copy on-hand:</p>
            <pre><code>
function toggleOne(ParentId, theObject) {
/* Get the object that either is or will be the parent Node */
  var mylocation = document.getElementById(ParentId);
/* Check if theObject already has its intended parent,
   so we know whether to show or to hide */
  if (theObject.parentNode != mylocation) {
  /* Show */
    mylocation.appendChild(theObject);
  }
  else {
  /* Hide */
    mylocation.removeChild(theObject);
  }
}</code></pre>
            <pre><code>
/* Store theObject in a global variable so you can pass it
   to the function using the variable name: */
var toc = document.getElementById('toc');</code></pre>
            <p>See <a href="#g13">PG 13</a> for information on the advantages of this method, which keeps the behavior (JavaScript) separate from the presentation (CSS).</p>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Hiding Dimmed or "Ghost" Content from Screen Reader Users without Removing it Visually (as in Modal Windows)</h4>
        <p>When a modal window appears on screen, often the rest of the site is blocked from mouse access, keyboard access and obscured visually (usually darkened). The idea is that the user is supposed to focus on that modal window only. Until WAI-ARIA, there was no simple way to leave the image of the content on the screen without the possibility that screen readers would read outside the modal window, breaking the experience of the modal window for these users. WAI-ARIA's <code>aria-hidden</code> property can now be used for this.</p>
        <p>Set <code>aria-hidden</code> to <code>true</code> to hide the content from screen reader users. When the content becomes relevant again, <strong>be sure to</strong> set <code>aria-hidden</code> to <code>false</code>.</p>
        <p>This property <strong>will have no visual effect</strong>, so be sure to test with a screen reader.</p>
        <p>While <code>aria-hidden</code> will prevent text in ghost content from being read with a screen reader, it will not stop tab and shift-tab from allowing keyboard users to leave the modal and get lost in the ghost content. Similarly, if a screen reader user uses tab or shift tab, they typically will still find the content that is hidden with aria-hidden. While keyboard traps are generally very bad for accessibility, this is one case where it's good to add code that keeps specifically tab and shift tab inside the dialog. Have the keyboard access cycle within the dialog as described here. If you do this, also be sure that the escape key will close the modal.</p>
        
        <h4>Caution</h4>
        <p>Aria-hidden is for content that developers have hidden visually and made inaccessible to keyboard access and mouse clicks (as in the background of a modal window). Occasionally, it can be used to work-around an issue for which the standard coding has not yet provided a solution. However, this should be very specific to specific problem (replace a word or two), it should not be used generally to create two large separate versions of content as in:</p>
        <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
          <li>An off-screen version for screen reader users. (not recommended)</li>
          <li>An on-screen version with aria-hidden and keyboard access removed for the average user. (not recommended)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The above is not a good idea because there are many users that are neither completely blind nor mouse users with 20/20 vision: </p>
        <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
          <li>There are users with mobility impairment that use vision plus keyboard access. </li>
          <li>There are users with learning disabilities that use the mouse plus text-to-speech out put, clicking words on the screen to hear them spoken.</li>
          <li>Users with low vision will often use magnification, plus speech output.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>iFrames Used for Scripting Purposes (not as part of the user interface)</h4>
        <p>Give the iframe a tabindex of -1 (negative one) to take it out of the tab order, and also set aria-hidden to true to prevent it from being read by screen readers:</p>
        <pre><code>&lt;iframe aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" ...&gt;</code></pre>
        <p><a href="utility_iframes.html" target="_blank">Open test page for utility iframes in a new window.</a></p>
        <p>If it is okay with your scripting technique in your supported browsers, another option is to use <code>display:none</code> to both hide these from screen readers and to prevent the iframe from appearing in the tab order.</p>
        
        <h3>Android Applications</h3>
        <p>To hide content from screen readers, set the <code>android:focusable</code> property set to <code>false</code>.</p>
        <p>Controls can be disabled using <code>setEnabled(false)</code> function.</p>
        
        <h3>iOS Applications</h3>
        <p>Some objects and any descendants of these objects such as <code>UIView</code>, <code>UIControl</code>, and <code>UIImageView</code> are not accessibility enabled by default and will be ignored automatically by VoiceOver.</p>
        <p>To explicitly hide content from screen readers, set the <code>setIsAccessibilityElement</code> property to <code>no</code>.</p>
        <p>Content that is dimmed or disabled will be announced as dimmed by VoiceOver. This is set using the <code>accessibilityTrait User Interaction Enabled</code>.</p>

      </div>

      <h2 id="g34">Guideline 34. Let user control the audio (User Control of Audio)</h2>
      <div class="guideline_content">
        <p class="summary">If audio plays longer than three seconds, either only play the audio on user request or allow it to be stopped easily using a screen reader. Allow users to restart and replay any audio that provides information.</p>
        <p>Note: This includes multimedia presentations with audio.</p>

        <h3>Rationale</h3>
        <p>Screen reader users need to be able to control when audio plays so that they can hear and focus either on what their screen reader is speaking or on the audio. When audio begins automatically, it can be difficult or impossible for a screen reader user to navigate to a stop button. Similarly, screen reader users may miss audio that plays just after the page loads, as their screen reader may be speaking a summary of what's on the page, such as, "Page has 3 Landmarks, 23 headings, and 212 links."</p>
        <p>Audio can also interfere with voice recognition software. If audio begins automatically and can't be stopped without navigating to a stop button, users with mobility impairment who use voice recognition to control the computer may not be able to turn off the audio.</p>

        <h3>Techniques</h3>
        <h4>Audio that does not Start Automatically</h4>
        <p>Ideally, do not have the audio play automatically and provide a play button with a stop or pause button near (or replacing) the play button.</p>
        
        <h4>Making Audio Easy to Stop</h4>
        <p>There are a few options for making audio easy to stop:</p>
        <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
          <li>Escape - If the audio begins automatically, allow the escape key to stop the audio. Be sure the escape key will work without the user having to move focus to any controls or to a video. Be sure to only capture escape once to stop the audio. When the audio is not playing, the escape key must have its default behavior.</li>
          <li>A stop or pause button at the top of the page - If audio begins automatically when a page or screen is loaded, include a Stop Audio button at the very beginning of that page or screen. Be sure this button is at the very beginning of the reading order. See Pearson Guideline 4 for more information on reading order.</li>
          <li>Moving focus to the stop or pause button - In some cases, it is okay to use scripting to move the focus to the stop or pause button if audio starts automatically. For example, if a video plays while you are advancing through a learning module and users know what to expect, you might place focus on the pause button right when the page loads.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Flash &amp; Flex</h3>
        <p>Ideally, Flash content should not use audio that plays automatically, but, when it does, the following must be implemented:</p>
        <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
          <li>Interactive controls that allow the audio to be paused and resumed.</li>
          <li>Global shortcuts that allow the user to pause and resume the audio.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Note that while implementing the shortcuts alone would meet this guideline, implementing both is recommended.</p>
        <p>Interactive controls can be as simple as basic buttons, but they can also be custom components (as long as these components are themselves accessible).</p>
        <p>For global keyboard shortcuts, it’s important to keep in mind that key event handlers defined within Flash are effective only within the Flash movie’s scope. In other words, Flash-based keyboard shortcuts work only when the current keyboard focus is placed inside the Flash movie. </p>
        <p>To resolve this, you can add JavaScript-based key handlers to the HTML document containing the Flash movie. The JavaScript-based event handlers can then call the Flash-based event handlers, using Flash’s ExternalInterface class. With this approach, keyboard shortcuts will work both inside and outside the Flash movie, ensuring that the user is always able to turn the sound off.</p>

        <h4>Enhancing Your Solution with Screen Reader Detection</h4>
        <p>Flash has the capability to check whether an MSAA client (which could be a screen reader) is currently running. Using this capability, you can prevent audio from playing automatically for screen reader users.</p>
        <p>The code snippet below shows how to set the autoPlay property of an existing FLVPlayback instance to false. This disables the entire movie (including audio) from playing automatically for screen reader users.</p>
        <pre><code>
import flash.accessibility.Accessibility;
import flash.system.Capabilities;
import fl.video.FLVPlayback;

var myPlayer:FLVPlayback;
// Capabilities.hasAccessibility 
// indicates whether the current operating system supports
// MSAA (which basically means that the OS is Windows based)
// Accessibility.active
// indicates whether an MSAA client is currently active

if (Capabilities.hasAccessibility &amp;&amp;
  Accessibility.active) {
  myPlayer.autoPlay = false;
}</code></pre>
        <p><strong>Note:</strong> The Accessibility.active check does not guarantee that all screen reader types are detected (it specifically checks for MSAA clients). This solution should only be used as a last resort, e.g. when it’s not possible to disable automatically playing audio for all users or make this behavior configurable by users.</p>

        <h4>Example with Keyboard Shortcuts, Toggle Button, and Screen Reader Detection</h4> 
        <p>The code example below shows a sample class that automatically starts playing music. The following features are included in this sample:</p>
        <ol class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--ordered">
          <li>A button is provided that allows users to stop the music.</li>
          <li>Shortcuts are defined in both the Flash movie as well as in the HTML document, allowing the user to pause / play (p), stop (esc), and restart (r) the music in either the Flash movie or the HTML content.</li>
          <li>The demo checks for the presence of a running screen reader and will not play the music automatically if one is detected.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The code includes inline comments to highlight each feature.</p>
        <p><strong>Note:</strong> This example uses a third party class for handling audio called 'SoundManager.' (<a target="_blank" href="http://evolve.reintroducing.com/2011/01/06/as3/as3-soundmanager-v1-4/">Open Web page about Sound Manager in a new window.</a>) This specific class is not required for this technique and is only used to simplify the code example below.</p>

        <p>For prerecorded audio-only content that (1) contains primarily speech in the foreground, (2) is not an audio CAPTCHA or audio logo, and (3) is not vocalization intended to be primarily musical expression such as singing or rapping, at least one of the following is true: (Level AAA) </p>
        <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
          <li>No Background: The audio does not contain background sounds.</li>
          <li>Turn Off: The background sounds can be turned off.</li>
          <li>20 dB: The background sounds are at least 20 decibels lower than the foreground speech content, with the exception of occasional sounds that last for only one or two seconds.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Note: Per the definition of "decibel," background sound that meets this requirement will be approximately four times quieter than the foreground speech content.</p>

      <h2 id="g36">Guideline 36. Provide transcripts and visual alerts for sounds that provide info (audio files, podcasts, video) (Transcripts &amp; Visual Alerts)</h2>
      <div class="guideline_content">
        <p class="summary">When audio provides information:</p>
        <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered summary">
          <li><p>Provide the same information in a text transcript</p>
            <p>OR</p>
          </li>
          <li>in the case of audio used to indicate status (e.g. a beep, "You've got mail"), provide a visual indication of status as well</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Note: If the audio is part of a multimedia presentation where the visual content is meaningful and is synchronized with the audio, follow <a href="#g37">Pearson Guideline 37</a> instead.</p>

        <h3>Rationale</h3>
        <p>This allows users with hearing impairments access the information in the audio content.</p>
        
        <h4>Additional Benefit:</h4>
        <p>Any user (including screen reader users) might prefer to use the text transcript in order to skim the material for key words or just to consume the material more quickly.</p>
        
        <h3>General Techniques</h3>
        <h4>Indicating Speakers, Tone of Voice &amp; Sound Effects in Transcripts</h4>
        <p>If there are multiple speakers, include that information in the text transcript. There are no set rules as to how to do this, but a common convention is to write the speaker's name, a colon, and then the speaker's speech.</p> 
        <p>If there are sound effects, if a speaker has a particular tone of voice, or if a speaker expresses something through a sound other than speech, include this information as well:</p>
        <div class="blue-box">
          <p>Diana: When I arrived, the cavern was full of water.</p>
          <p>Jim: <span style="font-style:italic;">[whispering]</span> Look, a blue footed booby! Well, it is high-tide.</p>
          <p>Diana: No, I don't mean that the cavern is simply flooded. It is full to the very brim with sea water. I've never seen it like this before. And, it has been this way for 24 hours.</p>
          <p><span style="font-style:italic;">[Splashing noises in the background]</span></p>
          <p>Jim: <span style="font-style:italic;">[gasps]</span> That's very strange!</p>
        </div>

        <h4>Sounds Used to Indicate Status</h4>
        <p>If you are using audio alerts that are built into a particular development platform, check to see if the sounds are automatically changed to visual alerts when you change system preferences. If so, there's nothing more you need to do for this guideline.</p>
        <p>If you use sound to let the user know that the application is in a particular state. For example, if the application beeps when a new message has been received, also provide this information in some visual way. For example, a small window with text such as "New Message from ..." may appear in the corner of the screen.</p>
        <p>If the visual status indicator is an image, be sure to also follow <a href="#g29">Pearson Guideline 29</a>, and give that image alt-text.</p>
        
        <h4>Pronunciations</h4>
        <p><img src="images/cavy.jpg" width="195" height="43" alt="An example shows the word cavy, the phonetic pronunciation and a sound icon. The pronunciation is written, k, a overline, apostrophe, v, e overline."><br>
        If the audio's purpose is to illustrate the pronunciation of the certain words, provide phonetic spellings on the page that plays the audio files.</p>
        
        <h3>HTML Transcripts</h3>
        <p>Any text-based document could be used to provide a transcript. But, HTML is often most convenient. HTML can be used to place the transcript on the page that plays the audio file. Or, a separate HTML page can be used as a transcript.</p>
        <p>The example shown in General Techniques was formatted in CSS and HTML as follows:</p>
        <pre><code>
&lt;style type="text/css"&gt;
.transcript {
  display: table;
  padding: 1em;
}
.line {
  display: table-row;
}
.speaker {
  display: table-cell;
  width: 4em;
}
quote {
  display: table-cell;
}
&lt;/style&gt;</code></pre>
        <pre><code>
&lt;div class="transcript"&gt;
  &lt;p class="line"&gt;
    &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Diana: &lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;When I arrived, the cavern was full of water.&lt;/quote&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p class="line"&gt;
    &lt;span class="speaker"&gt;Jim: &lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;[&lt;em&gt;whispering&lt;/em&gt;] Look, a blue footed booby! Well, it is high-tide.&lt;/quote&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  ...
  &lt;!-- To provide sound effects, close the div with class="transcript" --&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;[&lt;em&gt;Splashing noises in the background&lt;/em&gt;]&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;!-- After the sound effects, open another div with class="transcript" --&gt;
&lt;div class="transcript"&gt;
 ...
&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>

        <h3>Podcasts</h3>
        <p>Provide a separate RSS feed that delivers HTML/XHTML transcripts of the podcast on the same schedule as the podcast. Your readers can use an RSS aggregator to be notified of updates and to view the feed.</p>
        <p>RSS feeds are easy to create. All you need is some plain text files. Use ordinary (accessible) HTML files as the transcripts themselves. Create an RSS feed using a plain text file that you save with a <code>.xml</code> extension. Place this <code>.xml</code> file on the Web server along with your <code>.html</code> files. This file is the one you will link to using link text such as "RSS Feed: Transcripts of Professor Brown's Podcasts". Here is the basic structure of an RSS feed file:</p>
        <pre><code>
&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1" ?&gt;
&lt;rss version="2.0"&gt;
  &lt;channel&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Place the Title of Your Feed Here&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;link&gt;http://www.LinkToRelatedHomePage.com&lt;/link&gt;
    &lt;description&gt;Describe the feed&lt;/description&gt;
    &lt;language&gt;en-us&lt;/language&gt;
    &lt;item&gt;
      &lt;title&gt;Title of Most Recent Transcript Here&lt;/title&gt;
      &lt;link&gt;http://www.Pearson.com/MostRecent.html&lt;/link&gt;
      &lt;description&gt;Describe this transcript.&lt;/description&gt;
    &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;item&gt;
      &lt;title&gt;Title of Older Transcript Here&lt;/title&gt;
      &lt;link&gt;http://www.Pearson.com/Older.html&lt;/link&gt;
      &lt;description&gt;Describe this transcript.&lt;/description&gt;
    &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;copyright&gt;Copyright statement goes here.&lt;/copyright&gt;
  &lt;/channel&gt;
&lt;/rss&gt;</code></pre>
        <p>Notice that the more recent items are listed first. So, when you add new items, you need to add them to the beginning of the list of <code>&lt;item&gt;</code>s.</p>
        <p>For more background and detail on RSS feeds, see <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/xml/xml_rss.asp">W3Schools' RSS Tutorial</a>.</p>

      <h2 id="g37">Guideline 37. Provide captions for sounds that provide info (audio files, podcasts, video) (Captions)</h2>
      <div class="guideline_content">
        <p class="summary">When movies, animations, slideshows or games use synchronized visuals and sound to provide information, use captions to provide all important auditory information. </p>
        <p>Note: Captions are not required if the audio is a narrator reading on-screen text aloud.</p>

        <h3>Rationale</h3>
        <p>Captions provide an alternative to the audio content for people who can't hear the audio well or at all. They also benefit people with auditory processing dysfunction, a learning disability that makes taking in audio content difficult.</p>
        
        <h4>Additional Benefits:</h4>
        <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
          <li>Captions are useful to any user in environments where the sound is unavailable.</li>
          <li>Seeing the written text can improve comprehension for students who are new to the language spoken in the video.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>General Techniques</h3>
        <ol class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--ordered">
          <li>The caption text should be presented in short readable portions, as corresponding sounds play. </li>
          <li>Do not present captions as full paragraphs of text. Users will be reading the captions and watching the video through peripheral vision and by occasionally glancing at the video. They will not be able to keep their place in a full paragraph of text. Also, without sound, it can be difficult or impossible to know which sentence in the paragraph is relevant at any particular time.</li>
          <li>If there are multiple speakers, position captions to show who is speaking or include speaker IDs.</li>
          <li>Notate important sound effects. (e.g. "laughing", "a clap of thunder", "the door bell rings") </li>
          <li>Ideally, if there are periods of time where the only sounds are unimportant, notate these as well (e.g. "cheerful music"). This way, users who hear these sounds indistinctly won't wonder what the sound is, or what they might be missing.</li>

      <h2 id="g38">Guideline 38. Ensure that alternatives (e.g. transcripts, eBooks) mirror source materials (Mirroring Source Materials)</h2>
      <div class="guideline_content">
        <p class="summary">When creating alternative versions (e.g. alt-text for an image, e-book alternative to a printed text), keep content divisions (e.g. page numbers, learning unit divisions) and user interface elements (e.g. text label for a button, whether a list is numbered or bulleted) consistent with the standard version.</p>

        <h3>Rationale</h3>
        <p>Learners and instructors who use alternate versions not only need the same information as their peers, but also need to be able to communicate with others in the school environment regarding the materials. For example, instructors need to know which page to tell the class to go to. Students need to be able to draw their peers' attention to a particular element or to find an element that has been mentioned. This is true when the alternative is for a small portion of the media, as in a text alternative for an image, as well as when the alternative completely replaces the media, as in an e-book used to replace a printed textbook.</p>
        <p>Obviously, people can and will work around some of this type of issue through open communication. However, we want to do what we can to reduce as much as possible the amount of time spent on this type of clarification.</p>

        <h3>General Techniques</h3>
        <ol class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--ordered">
          <li><a href="#g29">Pearson Guideline 29</a> explains that alt-text should not describe the image but instead should replace the image. However, for significant images that provide information, alt-text should identify the type of image (e.g. photograph, cartoon, line graph). Images come with these inherent identification queues, allowing people to easily refer to the images. As such, for images likely to be discussed, replacing the image includes replacing this key identifying information. Place such identifying information at the beginning of the alt-text (i.e. "A cartoon shows...", "A graph illustrates...", "Photograph of...".) This way, when a student or instructor refers to the item, a student who uses alt-text can find the item being discussed. This does not apply to images used as user interface elements. For example, if a drawing of a house is used as a link to the home page, the alt-text should simply be "Home," not "Drawing of a house". Also, screen readers will let the user know that an item is an image, so there is no need to mention "image".</li>
          <li><p>When providing an alternative for media that is organized by divisions (e.g. chapters, pages), include the same divisions in the alternative version. This way, when an instructor assigns a particular portion of the media or a particular portion of the media is discussed in class (e.g. "at the top of page 12", "the folk song at the beginning of Chapter 2"), all students can identify the relevant content. Examples:</p>
              <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
                <li>If a recorded lecture is divided into three parts, ensure that the text transcript is divided correspondingly. </li>
                <li>If an ebook is provided as an alternative for a printed (or otherwise inaccessible) textbook, ensure that chapter numbers, section numbers, subsection numbers, figure numbers, etc, correspond to these numbers in the printed textbook.</li>
                <li>Also, if an ebook is provided as an alternative for a printed (or otherwise inaccessible) textbook:
                    <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
                      <li>Be sure that page divisions and numbers that correspond to the printed book are present by default or can be displayed</li>
                      <li>And, provide a feature that allows users to find the location in the alternative ebook that matches the beginning of any printed page. For example, you might provide "jump to page," "next page" and "previous page" user input controls, allowing the ebook users to, for example, "open to page 34" and "go to the next page" with the rest of the class.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
              </ul>
          </li>
          <li><p>Use the same heading, label and title text that is used for standard access when coding for accessibility. For example, in HTML, if an image of text is used as heading, the alt-text for the image should correspond to the text on the image. In the code below, an image of text that reads "Historic Note" has alt-text that also says "Historic Note." If a professor should ask the class why the "Historic Note" is relevant, all students including those using screen readers will be able to identify the section being discussed.</p>
            <pre><code>&lt;h4&gt;&lt;img src="image_that_says_Historic_Note.gif"           alt="Historic Note"&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;</code></pre>
            <p>(It is ok to provide additional information for screen reader users if needed.)</p>
          </li>
        </ol>

      <div class="guideline_content">
        <p class="summary">When end users (e.g. students, instructors) can upload or create content, allow and facilitate alternatives for non-text content (e.g. alt-text for images, captions and audio descriptions for video, transcripts for audio) and, where significant text editing is possible, semantic markup (e.g. headings, data tables, and lists).</p>

        <h3>Rationale</h3>
        <p>This helps users with disabilities access information provided by fellow users.</p>

        <h3>General Techniques</h3>
        <h4>Generating Information</h4>
        <p>If possible, automatically generate alt-text, transcripts, captions and/or audio descriptions. Most often, this is not possible today. But, in some cases it is, for example:</p>
        <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
          <li>If a profile photo that the user uploads is used to represent the user without accompanying onscreen text, the user's name might be used as alt-text.</li>
          <li>If a user creates an avatar or another object using tools within your product, the physical characteristics that the user chooses might be used to generate alt-text for the avatar or object.</li>
          <li>If a user can choose a voice and type what the voice should say, a transcript can be automatically generated.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Collecting Information</h4>
        <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
          <li>Allow users to enter or upload alt-text or transcripts. </li>
          <li>Allow users to indicate if non-text content is purely decorative and should be skipped by screen readers.</li>
          <li>Allow users to upload multimedia that includes captions and audio description. (And/or provide a service that adds these features.)</li>
          <li>Automatically detect which accessibility features are available and/or allow users to indicate which accessibility features they've added.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Displaying Alternatives</h4>
        <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
          <li>When displaying user-provided content, include alternatives for non-text content, as described in <a href="#g27">Pearson Guidelines 27</a>, <a href="#g28">28</a>, &amp; <a href="#g34">34</a>.</li>
          <li>If the non-text content is known to be decorative, employ the techniques described in <a href="#g32">Pearson Guideline 32</a>.</li>
          <li>If applicable, allow users to search for content based on accessibility features. For example, when searching a database of educational video, students might be given the option to indicate that captioned video should be given priority in search results.</li>

      <h2 id="g40">Guideline 40. Use accessible publishing options (e.g. PDF settings, Flash import scripts) (Publishing Options &amp; Security)</h2>
      <div class="guideline_content">
        <p class="summary">Publish your media so that the accessibility features for the media are included and so that screen readers work with any security features.</p>

        <h3>Rationale</h3>
        <p>Sometimes authoring tools that produce media allow publication of files that do not include the accessibility features that are available in the media type. The inaccessible publication options may even be the default setting. </p>
        <p>Similarly, some media types offer security options that do not work with screen readers.</p>
        <p>For many media types and especially Flash, Flex and PDF, selecting the correct publishing options is as important as basic accessibility techniques, such as adding alternative text or providing a sensible reading order.</p>

        <h3>HTML &amp; JavaScript</h3>
        <h4>Do not use <code>role="application"</code> except where your application will handle all keystrokes for keyboard access and screen readers</h4>
        <p>This role causes the screen reader to switch to a mode where your application is expected to handle key presses.</p>
        
        <h4>Digital Rights Management (DRM)</h4>
        <p>If you use security techniques to prevent text from being copied and pasted or otherwise easily shared, be sure that screen readers will still be able to access the text. Include screen reader access in both your requirements and your test plan for Digital Rights Management techniques.</p>
        
        <h4>Password Protection</h4>
        <p>If you password protect your pages, user interface features associated with the password protection (e.g. log in page, registration page) must be accessible.</p>
        
        <h4>Browser Chrome / Browser Toolbars (Recommendation)</h4>
        <p>Although this is not a strict requirement of the standards, browser toolbars should not be removed as they provide access to accessibility features such as:</p>
        <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
          <li>zoom or resize text</li>
          <li>custom style sheets</li>
          <li>adjustable font face and font colors</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Android Applications</h3>
        <p>Android provides functions for changing the font size that are set at the system level. To enable system font size in your app, mark text and their associated containers to be measured in scale pixels. </p>
        <p>When users have large fonts enabled or the labels support internationalization, their type might be larger than the space allotted for the control label. Read <a href="https://developer.android.com/design/style/devices-displays.html">Devices and Displays</a> and <a href="https://developer.android.com/guide/practices/screens_support.html">Supporting Multiple Screens</a> for more information on how to support flexible layout.</p>
         
        <h3>iOS Applications</h3>
        <h4>iOS applications should honor the user settings defined in the operating system.</h4>
        <p>Support Dynamic Type where possible within the application. Dynamic Type will automatically adjust to letter spacing and line height for every font size, provide the ability to specify different text styles for semantically distinct blocks of text, and the text will respond appropriately to changes the user makes to text-size settings (including accessibility text sizes). If the application uses a custom font, the text can be scaled according to the system setting for text size programmatically. Ensure that the application responds appropriately when the user changes the setting.To learn how to use text styles and ensure that your app gets notified when the user changes the text size setting, see <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/StringsTextFonts/Conceptual/TextAndWebiPhoneOS/CustomTextProcessing/CustomTextProcessing.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40009542-CH4-SW65">Text Styles</a> in <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/StringsTextFonts/Conceptual/TextAndWebiPhoneOS/CustomTextProcessing/CustomTextProcessing.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40009542-CH4-SW65"><i>Text Programming Guide for iOS</i></a>.</p>
         
        <h3>PDF in Acrobat</h3>
        <h4>Security Settings</h4>
        <p>If the PDF security settings are required, select the option to "Enable text access for screen reader devices for the visually impaired". If this is not selected, the document cannot be read by screen readers even if it has been tagged.</p>

        <h4>Unicode</h4>
        <p>In a PDF document, text is rendered for display using specific graphic designs that are captured in fonts called glyphs. The text content of pages is in glyphs not characters and the text is then interpreted using <a href="http://unicode.org/">Unicode</a>, a common character encoding technology. If a character used on the page does not have a Unicode equivalent, then the text cannot be read by screen readers. </p>
        <p>Common Issues:</p>
        <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
          <li>Non–standard bullet characters</li>
          <li>Symbols and other document markers</li>
          <li>Some fonts</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If there are Unicode issues within the PDF document, running the full accessibility check in Acrobat will generate an error. To fix these errors, choose a different font and generate the PDF again.</p>
        <p>For characters and symbols:</p>
        <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
          <li>If the symbol or character does not convey information, change it to an artifact.</li>
          <li>If a character used conveys information, either change the font or add it as an image with alternative text. These changes will need to be made in the source document then converted to a PDF.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Related Guidelines</h3>
        <p>In general, most standards merely imply that this guideline be met! This is so essential, it tends to be overlooked in the process of writing guidelines. However, the guidelines listed below are closely related to this idea.</p>

        <a class="skippy" href="#toc">Back to TOC</a>
      </div>

      <h2 id="g41">Guideline 41. Provide links to accessible players (Links to Accessible Players)</h2>
      <div class="guideline_content">
        <p class="summary">If your product's accessibility relies on more than the user's assistive technology and a common Web browser, provide a link to an accessible download location for each add-on (e.g. plugin, player, script).</p>

        <h3>Rationale</h3>
        <p>Some technologies are only accessible when used with particular browsers, plugins, players and scripts. </p>
        <p>For example, some accessible FLEX UI components require scripts for compatibility with the JAWS screen reader. Even with thorough accessibility coding and testing, JAWS users won't be able to access the affected UI elements unless the information about the need for the scripts is made available to them.</p>

        <h3>Technology Specifics</h3>
        <h4>HTML | XHTML | CSS | JavaScript</h4>
        <ol class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--ordered">
          <li>Users who use keyboard access without a screen reader will require a special tool to use headings navigation:
              <ul class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--unordered">
                <li><p>the Opera Web browser</p>

              </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Otherwise, the tools needed for accessible HTML/XHTML are so well-known that we don't have to provide the information with our products.</li>

        <h4>508 Web § 1194.22 (m)</h4>
        <p>When a web page requires that an applet, plug-in or other application be present on the client system to interpret page content, the page must provide a link to a plug-in or applet that complies with §1194.21(a) through (l).</p>

      </div>

      <h2 id="g42">Guideline 42. Document your product's accessibility (Document Accessibility)</h2>
      <div class="guideline_content">
        <p class="summary">Document the accessibility of your product by recording what your team did to meet each guideline.</p>

        <h3>Rationale</h3>
        <h4>Recording what was done helps the full team to maintain the features.</h4>
        <p>For internal purposes, this document will track the accessibility level through releases, ensuring changes do not cause the product to fall short of professional user interface coding. For example, a user experience professional might carefully assign labels to each form field, making sure that the 'for' attributes in the labels match the 'id' attributes in the form fields. An engineer may later need to change the ids of each form field. If an accessibility document has been handed from the user experience team to the engineering team, the engineers are less likely to change the form fields' ids without also updating the label elements' 'for' attributes. Similarly, if the document is passed to the quality assurance team, quality assurance professionals will know to test the features.</p>

        <h4>Let customers know about the accessibility of your product</h4>
        <p>This document is also key to fully realizing return on investment for following standards. Like most technical standards, accessibility standards help to ensure that our software and content is reusable, future-compatible, and robust. However, more so than with other technical standards, customers are interested in detailed information on the level of accessibility. This is because unlike other standards, details on accessibility standards are key to understanding who can use which pieces of an application. This information is essential to customers with disabilities and it helps schools to meet their obligations to students with disabilities. As such, the document can be used to provide information to customers who are looking to purchase an accessible product. Some schools are setting up databases to store such documents for all products they've evaluated to speed up their evaluation process.</p>

        <h4>Helping customers to plan when the product is not yet fully accessible</h4>
        <p>Even when a product is not fully accessible, the document can be useful for customers with disabilities and for those who provide services for students with disabilities. Customers with disabilities can optimize their time and what they get from the product if they know what will work for them and what won't. If 75% of the features in a product are fully accessible to a particular customer, the time and frustration experienced when encountering the 25% that is not can render the entire experience inaccessible. However, if the customer has a document that explains which items will not work, he or she can plan accordingly and avoid spending any time within those areas. In that case, the 75% that is accessible can be very useful.</p>
        <p>When there are no fully accessible products of a particular type available on the market, schools will need to know how the products they have to choose from are accessible and how they are not. This helps schools with policies obligating them to purchase the most accessible product available. It also helps schools to plan how to best use their resources to support the students working with the products.</p>
      
        <h4>Reduce the Need for Costly Accessibility Evaluations</h4>
        <p>While there are many times when a full outside accessibility review is essential, this can be expensive. Keeping an internal document up-to-date as we develop and enhance the products allows us to avoid such reviews for minor releases.</p>
         
        <h3>Accessibility Templates</h3>
        <p>In the United States, documents that provide details on the accessibility of a product are often called VPATs (pronounced Vee Pat). These documents are written by filling in a <a href="http://www.itic.org/policy/accessibility/vpat">Voluntary Product Accessibility Template</a> designed by the Information Technology Industry Council and the U.S. General Services Administration. The template is a table that lists the current Section 508 standards and provides space and specific language for comment on how each standard was addressed.</p>
        <p>The Section 508 guidelines are under revision and the current international standards require more than the current Section 508 standards. Because of this, to answer international and future customer inquiries, we need to record more information than the current VPAT template is designed to hold. So we recommend using a Pearson Accessibility Template (<a href="http://wps.pearsoned.com/wps/media/objects/7400/7578605/PearsonAccessibiltyTemplate_V1.doc">PearsonAccessibiltyTemplate_V1.doc</a> ) instead. The Pearson Accessibility Template is designed to hold all of the information you'll need if a customer asks for a VPAT, if a customer asks how the product complies with the international standards, etc.</p>
        <p>Pearson Accessibility Templates can also serve as requirements documents. Attach the template to your requirements document and ask each person who modifies or tests the product to add to the commentary. This is a great way to track the level of accessibility that design and development vendors provide.</p>

        <h3>General Techniques</h3>
        <ol class="pe-list pe-styled-lists--ordered">
          <li>While many team members will contribute to the information in the Pearson Accessibility Template for your product, one point person should be assigned responsibility for the document. This could be a product manager, project manager or a QA lead, depending on your team's size and structure.</li>
          <li>Attach the <a href="https://neo.pearson.com/external-link.jspa?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwps.pearsoned.com%2Fwps%2Fmedia%2Fobjects%2F7400%2F7578605%2FPearsonAccessibiltyTemplate_V1.doc">Pearson Accessibility Template (.doc)</a> to your requirements document and ask each group that modifies or tests the product to add commentary.</li>
          <li>Update the document with each release.</li>
          <li>Create an accessibility statement for end-users, including information on whom to contact to report any accessibility issues.</li>
